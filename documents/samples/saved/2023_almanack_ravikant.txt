"Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep."

My note: Money is a tool. Status is relative. Wealth is freedom.

---

"You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom."

My note: Trading time for money has a ceiling. Ownership doesn't.

---

"Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now."

My note: Don't chase trends. Chase interests. That's where unique value emerges.

---

"Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."

My note: Every desire is a source of suffering. Be careful what you want.

---

"A happy person isn't someone who's happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace."

My note: Happiness is interpretation, not circumstances. The Stoics said this too.
