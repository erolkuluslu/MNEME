TITLE: The Meaning Crisis
AUTHOR: Saved synthesis
DATE: 2024-01-20

The problem:

Traditional sources of meaning have declined:
- Religion
- Community
- Stable careers
- Clear life scripts

What's left? Consumer choice. Not enough.

Symptoms:

- Rising anxiety, depression
- "Deaths of despair"
- Nihilism, especially in young people
- Searching in ideologies, cults, online communities

John Vervaeke's framework:

Three crises intertwined:
1. Crisis of meaning (what matters?)
2. Crisis of wisdom (how to live?)
3. Crisis of community (who do I belong to?)

Potential answers:

- Practices (meditation, contemplation)
- Communities of practice
- Re-connection to embodiment
- Rediscovering wisdom traditions

My take:

I've felt this. The Stoics, meditation, therapy, relationships—all patches on the meaning wound.

But maybe that's the point. Meaning isn't found. It's made. Through practice, relationship, commitment.

The crisis is invitation to construct meaning deliberately rather than inherit it passively.
