Principles I've adopted:

1. SHOW UP CONSISTENTLY
Consistency beats intensity. Small daily actions compound.

2. CHOOSE DISCOMFORT
Growth requires difficulty. If it's too easy, you're not growing.

3. PROTECT ATTENTION
What you attend to becomes your life. Guard it fiercely.

4. INVEST IN RELATIONSHIPS
People matter more than achievements.

5. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
Memory fails. Write it down.

6. OWN YOUR CHOICES
No one else is responsible. Not luck, not others. Me.

7. REST IS PRODUCTIVE
Recovery enables performance. Sleep is non-negotiable.

8. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
Few things done well beat many things done poorly.

9. START BEFORE YOU'RE READY
Perfection is procrastination. Ship and iterate.

10. REMEMBER MORTALITY
Time is limited. Act accordingly.

These aren't original. They're synthesized from everything I've learned.

The goal isn't knowing them. It's living them.
