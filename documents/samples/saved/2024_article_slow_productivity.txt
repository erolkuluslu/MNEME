The thesis:

Modern knowledge work is broken. We measure busyness, not results. Always on, always behind.

The alternative: Slow productivity

Three principles:

1. DO FEWER THINGS
Active projects limited. Finish before starting new.

2. WORK AT A NATURAL PACE
Seasonality. Variation. Not constant intensity.

3. OBSESS OVER QUALITY
Craftsmanship over output volume.

The historical context:

Before industrial era, creative workers worked slowly. Thoreau, Darwin, Newton—years on single projects. Seasons of intensity and rest.

We've industrialized knowledge work inappropriately.

My reflection:

I feel the constant urgency. The inbox. The notifications. The sense of never being done.

What would "slow productivity" look like for me?

- Fewer active projects
- Protect deep work time
- Accept that some things won't get done
- Quality over quantity
- Stop measuring hours

The irony: Slowing down might produce more meaningful output.
