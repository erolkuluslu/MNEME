The method (after much experimentation):

1. 3 eggs + pinch of salt, whisk until homogeneous

2. Cold butter (1 tbsp) in cold non-stick pan

3. Low heat (seriously, LOW)

4. Add eggs, stir constantly with silicone spatula

5. Remove from heat when still slightly wet (carryover cooking)

6. Fold in more cold butter (1 tsp) to stop cooking

7. Finish with chives, flaky salt

The key: PATIENCE. Takes 10+ minutes. The slow cooking creates small, creamy curds.

My note:

I used to blast eggs on high heat. Rubber. These eggs are a different dish entirely.

Maya says these are "fancy restaurant eggs." From the same ingredients. Just technique.

Lesson: Quality often isn't ingredients. It's care.
