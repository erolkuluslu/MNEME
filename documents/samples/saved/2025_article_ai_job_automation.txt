TITLE: Which Jobs Will AI Actually Replace?
AUTHOR: Saved with notes
DATE: 2025-03-15

The nuanced view:

Not "AI will replace jobs" but "AI will replace tasks."

Most jobs are bundles of tasks. Some tasks automatable, others not.

Tasks AI handles well:

- Pattern recognition in data
- Routine text generation
- Code boilerplate
- Scheduling, admin
- Initial drafts, first passes

Tasks AI handles poorly:

- Novel problem-solving
- Emotional intelligence, empathy
- Physical dexterity in unstructured environments
- Judgment in ambiguous situations
- Creative direction (not just generation)

The reshaping:

Jobs won't disappear. They'll transform.

The lawyer still exists, but AI does discovery. The designer still exists, but AI does first drafts.

My reflection:

I use AI daily. It automates my boring tasks. Frees me for interesting ones.

The question isn't "Will I be replaced?" but "How do I complement AI?"

Skills that complement:
- Judgment and taste
- Problem framing
- Interpersonal skills
- Integration and synthesis
- Knowing what to ask for

The meta-skill: Learning to work WITH AI. That's the new literacy.
