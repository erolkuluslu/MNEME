Highlights and reflections:

---

"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any circumstances."

My note: Even in the worst conditions imaginable, Frankl kept this. It's a high standard. But it means complaining about my circumstances is a choice I'm making.

---

"When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves."

My note: So much energy spent trying to change unchangeable things. The Stoics and Frankl agree: focus on yourself.

---

"Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose."

My note: This is the whole game. I feel anger → space → I choose my response. Meditation trains that space.

---

"Those who have a 'why' to live can bear with almost any 'how'."

My note: Purpose matters more than comfort. Why am I doing this? That's the anchor.

---

Three ways to meaning:
1. Creating a work or deed
2. Experiencing something or encountering someone
3. The attitude toward unavoidable suffering

My note: All three paths available. I don't need #3 to be suffering. #1 and #2 are available right now.

Overall: This book wrecked me. Frankl found meaning in Auschwitz. My problems are trivial by comparison. But the framework applies at any scale. Find meaning. Choose attitude. Create the space between stimulus and response.
