Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your Word

"Your word is the power you have to create. It is a gift that comes directly from God."

My note: Speech creates reality. What I say becomes my world. Gossip, self-criticism, lies—they poison.

Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally

"Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality."

My note: Their actions are about THEM. Not me. This is freedom from emotional hostage-taking.

---

Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions

"We have the tendency to make assumptions about everything... We only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear."

My note: I fill in gaps with stories. Usually wrong. Ask instead of assume.

---

Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best

"Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick."

My note: Not perfectionism. Just the best I can do right now. Some days that's less. That's okay.

Overall: Simple framework. Four principles. Incredibly hard to follow consistently. I return to this when I'm spiraling.
