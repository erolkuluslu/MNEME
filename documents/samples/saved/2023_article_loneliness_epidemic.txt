Key stat:

50% of Americans report having three or fewer close friends. Up from 27% in 1990.

Causes identified:

1. Rise of remote work and online interaction
2. Decline of community institutions (church, clubs)
3. Geographic mobility—people move more
4. Social media replacing in-person connection
5. "Bowling alone" phenomenon

Health impact:

"Loneliness increases mortality risk as much as smoking 15 cigarettes a day."

My reflection:

I felt this during the pandemic. Even with internet, real connection requires presence.

I've been intentional since:
- Regular friend meetups (non-negotiable)
- Calling over texting when possible
- Third places (coffee shop, gym) for ambient connection
- Saying yes to invitations by default

The irony:

We're more connected than ever and lonelier than ever. Connection and presence are different.

Quality over quantity. Deep over wide.
