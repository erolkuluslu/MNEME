The poem:

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

Why this resonates:

It reframes difficult emotions. They're not enemies to fight. They're guests to receive.

Non-resistance. Acceptance. Even welcoming.

This is what meditation taught me. Thoughts and feelings come. Let them be. They pass.

Fighting makes them stronger. Welcoming lets them move through.
