The concept:

An antilibrary is the collection of books you haven't read.

Eco had 30,000 books. Most unread. Visitors asked "Have you read all these?" He said: "Why would I keep books I've read?"

The point:

Unread books are more valuable than read books. They represent what you don't know.

A growing library should mean a growing sense of what you don't know.

The application:

Don't feel guilty about unread books. They're reminders of remaining knowledge.

Buy books faster than you read them. The stack is humility made visible.

My antilibrary:

About 100 unread books. I used to feel bad about this. Now I see it as my learning queue. My map of unknown territory.

The shelf says: "Here is what you could learn."
