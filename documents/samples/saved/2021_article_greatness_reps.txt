TITLE: Greatness Is Just Lots of Reps

The argument:

We attribute mastery to talent. Usually it's just volume.

The Beatles played 10,000 hours in Hamburg clubs before anyone knew them.

Comedians bomb for years before they're "overnight successes."

Writers produce thousands of pages of garbage before anything good.

The implication:

Stop waiting to be good. Start putting in reps. Quantity enables quality.

"The ceramics teacher announced that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side would be graded on quantity, all those on the right would be graded on quality. At the end of the semester, the highest quality pots came from the quantity group."

My takeaway:

I hesitate because I want output to be good. But hesitation prevents the reps needed to become good.

Ship more. Judge less. Iterate.
