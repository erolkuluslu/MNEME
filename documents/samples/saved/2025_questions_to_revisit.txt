TITLE: Questions I Keep Asking Myself
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2025-04-15

Questions I return to periodically:

DIRECTION:
- Am I proud of how I'm spending my days?
- What would I regret not doing?
- What am I optimizing for?

PRIORITIES:
- What's actually important vs. what feels urgent?
- If I could only work on one thing, what would it be?
- What can I eliminate?

RELATIONSHIPS:
- Am I investing in the right people?
- Who do I want to be more like?
- Who drains me that I should see less?

GROWTH:
- What am I learning?
- Where am I coasting?
- What discomfort am I avoiding?

MEANING:
- Why does this matter?
- What would I do if money wasn't a constraint?
- How do I want to be remembered?

I don't have answers to all of these. But asking keeps me honest.

Review annually. Track how answers change.
