On the nature of self:

"You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing."

My note: Not a separate entity. A process. A happening. This reframes everything.

---

On trying too hard:

"Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone."

My note: Sometimes non-action is the action. Overthinking makes things worse.

---

On living in the present:

"The art of living... is neither careless drifting on the one hand nor fearful clinging to the past and the known on the other."

My note: Not reckless. Not anxious. Present and engaged.

---

On words and reality:

"We do not 'come into' this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree."

My note: Language shapes thought. "I came into the world" suggests separation. "I grew out of it" suggests connection.

---

On wu wei (non-action):

"Wu wei is the art of sailing rather than rowing."

My note: Work with forces, not against them. Efficiency through alignment, not effort.

---

Overall: Watts is the bridge between East and West for me. He translates concepts that feel alien into accessible wisdom. This book plus my Japan trip rewired my thinking.
