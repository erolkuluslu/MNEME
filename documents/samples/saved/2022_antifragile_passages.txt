"Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes fire."

My note: Same stressor, different effects. Some things die from volatility. Others grow.

---

"The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors."

My note: Errors are information. Systems that can't handle errors are fragile.

---

"We have been fragilizing the economy, our health, political life, education, almost everything... by suppressing randomness and volatility."

My note: Overprotection creates fragility. Kids who never fail can't handle failure. Systems without stress testing break under stress.

---

"The simpler the better. Complications lead to multiplicative chains of unanticipated effects."

My note: Complexity is fragile. Simple is robust.

"The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations."

My note: Antifragility as life philosophy. Embrace variation, change, challenge. It's what keeps you alive.

Taleb is cantankerous but insightful. This book changed how I think about systems, risk, and life design.
