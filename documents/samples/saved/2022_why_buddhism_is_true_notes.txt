Key concept: Natural selection designed us for survival, not happiness or clear perception.

"The human brain is, in large part, a machine for winning arguments."

My note: Confirmation bias isn't a bug. It's a feature—for tribal survival. But bad for truth-seeking.

---

"We are not designed to see truth clearly. We are designed to survive and reproduce."

My note: Evolution doesn't care about our wellbeing. Understanding this helps explain suffering.

---

On meditation:

"The point is not to eliminate feelings but to see them clearly—to observe them without necessarily reacting to them."

My note: Not emotionlessness. Emotional clarity. The space between stimulus and response.

---

On the self:

"The self is more like a story we tell than a thing that exists."

My note: "I" is a narrative, not a solid entity. Buddhism and neuroscience agree on this.

---

Overall: Wright argues Buddhism's claims are validated by modern psychology and neuroscience. The brain generates suffering through evolved mechanisms. Meditation is a technology for seeing past those mechanisms.

I don't buy everything, but the overlap between ancient wisdom and modern science is striking.
