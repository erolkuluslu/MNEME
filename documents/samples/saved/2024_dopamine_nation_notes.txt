The balance metaphor:

Pleasure and pain are on a balance. The brain seeks equilibrium.

After pleasure → compensatory pain (comedown)
After pain → compensatory pleasure (relief/reward)

"If we keep pressing on the pleasure side of the balance, it tips to the side of pain."

My note: This explains tolerance and addiction. More stimulation needed for same effect. The balance tilts.

On modern life:

"We are living in a time of unprecedented access to high-reward, high-dopamine stimuli: drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing..."

My note: Our environment is a supernormal stimulus. We're not evolved for this.

The solution:

"The paradoxical healing power of pain" - Deliberate exposure to controlled discomfort (cold showers, fasting, exercise) resets the balance.

My note: This is why cold showers feel good AFTER. Why fasting increases food appreciation. Why hard workouts produce calm.

Overall: This reframed my relationship with pleasure-seeking. The scroll for dopamine hits is actually creating long-term pain. Strategic discomfort creates long-term wellbeing.
