Key quotes:

"Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."

My note: Every desire is future-oriented suffering. Be careful what you want.

"Happiness is a choice you make and a skill you develop."

My note: Not a result. A practice.

"A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought—they must be earned."

My note: The most valuable things require work, not money.

"If you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with them for a day."

My note: Applied to relationships too. Does this have forever potential?

"The more you know, the less you diversify."

My note: Interesting. Diversification is for uncertainty. Knowledge reduces need for it.

Overall: Naval is quotable to the point of being overwhelming. But these hit.
