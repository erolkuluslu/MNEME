Core thesis:

From newspapers to TV to social media, the business model is the same: capture attention, sell it to advertisers.

You are not the customer. You are the product.

The evolution:

1. Newspapers: Sell ads against content
2. Radio: "Free" programming, sponsored
3. TV: Peak attention capture, commercial interruption
4. Internet: Personalized, infinite, algorithmic

Each generation more sophisticated at harvesting attention.

The arms race:

Every year, the techniques improve. Better targeting. Better engagement hooks. More addictive design.

We're not getting better at resisting. They're getting better at capturing.

My reflection:

I feel this. The pull to check my phone. The scroll that extends beyond intention. The notification that hijacks focus.

My attention is my life. What I attend to is what I experience. Letting algorithms choose is letting them live my life.

Strategies I'm using:
- Notification off except calls/texts
- App timers
- Phone-free zones (bedroom, meals)
- Analog alternatives (physical books, paper journals)

This is defensive warfare against an enemy that never sleeps.
