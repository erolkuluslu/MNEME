The question posed:

If AI can do everything humans do, what's left for us?

---

Key passage:

"The meaning crisis isn't caused by AI. AI just accelerates it. We've been losing meaning since industrialization separated work from craft, productivity from purpose."

My reflection: True. AI didn't break meaning. It just makes the break undeniable.

---

"Humans may find meaning not in what we produce but in how we live, who we love, what we choose."

My reflection: Output-based meaning is vulnerable to automation. Process-based meaning isn't.

---

"The monk who sweeps the temple finds meaning in sweeping, not in a clean floor."

My reflection: The sourdough I make isn't objectively "better" than store-bought. The meaning is in the making.

Overall synthesis:

AI forces a question we should have asked anyway: What is this all for?

If AI does my job, am I worthless? Only if my worth was only in my job.

The answer can't be "productivity." It has to be something deeper. Relationships. Experience. Growth. Contribution. Choice.

Maybe AI is a gift—freeing us from the illusion that meaning comes from output.
