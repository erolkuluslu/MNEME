TITLE: Sleep Optimization Protocols
AUTHOR: Me (notes from podcast)

Key protocols:

1. LIGHT EXPOSURE
- Morning sunlight within 30 min of waking (10+ min)
- Triggers cortisol spike, sets circadian rhythm
- Evening: Dim lights after sunset

My note: Started morning walks. Noticeable impact on evening tiredness.

2. TEMPERATURE
- Body temp drops for sleep, rises for waking
- Cool bedroom (65-68°F)
- Warm bath before bed → subsequent cooling helps initiation

My note: Changed bedroom to 66°F. Fall asleep faster.

3. CAFFEINE
- Half-life: 5-6 hours
- Stop 8-10 hours before bed
- "Adenosine debt" accumulates if caffeinating too early

My note: No caffeine after 2pm rule. Hard but effective.

4. TIMING
- Consistent wake time matters more than consistent bed time
- Sleep pressure builds with time awake
- Weekend sleep-ins disrupt Monday

My note: Same wake time every day, even weekends. The adjustment was worth it.

5. SUPPLEMENTS (his protocols)
- Magnesium threonate
- Apigenin
- Theanine

My note: Tried magnesium. Subtle but positive. Skip the rest for now.

Overall: Sleep is a force multiplier. Everything else—cognition, mood, health—depends on it. These protocols are simple. Actually doing them is the challenge.
