TITLE: How to Develop Good Taste

Key insight:

"Taste is just the ability to recognize good work. You develop taste by looking at lots of work and asking: is this good? Why?"

The process:

1. Expose yourself to lots of work (good and bad)
2. Compare. What's better? Why?
3. Articulate. Put reasons into words.
4. Iterate. Taste refines over time.

Why taste matters:

"Most great work comes from someone who had the taste to recognize their own bad work and keep iterating."

Without taste, you can't tell good from bad. You ship bad work thinking it's good.

My reflection:

I have developing taste in some areas (code, bread). Underdeveloped in others (design, writing).

The fix: Exposure + comparison + articulation.

Look at great design. Ask why it's great. Try to make something. Compare. Repeat.
