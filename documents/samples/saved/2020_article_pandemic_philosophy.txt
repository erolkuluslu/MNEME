Key passage:

"Plague reveals what's always true but usually hidden: that we are fragile, that we are connected, that we are mortal."

My reflection:

The pandemic stripped illusions. We thought we controlled more than we do.

Stoic relevance:

Marcus Aurelius ruled during plague. His reflections on mortality weren't abstract—they were lived.

The opportunity:

Crisis clarifies priorities. What matters when everything is threatened?

For me: Health, relationships, meaningful work. Not status, stuff, or busy-ness.

Quote to remember:

"We should not let a crisis go to waste. The question is what we will learn from it."

What I want to learn: Appreciation for normalcy. Prioritization of what matters. Resilience for future crises.
