The argument:

We're thoughtful about food diets. Why not information diets?

What we consume mentally matters. Junk information creates junk thoughts.

The framework:

1. AUDIT: What information sources do I consume daily? Are they nutritious or junk?

2. CUT JUNK: News that doesn't affect decisions. Social media that triggers comparison. Controversy for controversy's sake.

3. ADD NUTRITION: Books. Deep articles. Primary sources. Things that build knowledge.

4. SCHEDULE: Don't graze. Consume information at designated times.

My information diet:

CUT: Twitter (mostly). News apps (completely). Random YouTube.

KEEP: Books. Newsletters from thoughtful people. Podcasts (selectively). Direct conversations.

SCHEDULE: Morning = no news/social. Reading time = evening.

The result:

Less anxious. Better informed about things that matter. More time.

The insight: Most "staying informed" is actually "staying distracted."
