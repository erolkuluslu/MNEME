Key concept:

Dopamine isn't about pleasure. It's about motivation and pursuit. The anticipation, not the reward.

The baseline:

We have a dopamine baseline. Activities spike above baseline, then we drop below baseline (the comedown).

Constant high-dopamine activities → baseline drops → normal activities feel unsatisfying.

Practical implications:

1. INTERMITTENT REWARDS: Don't reward every workout with dopamine hit (phone, food). Sometimes just do the thing.

2. COLD EXPOSURE: Cold showers increase baseline dopamine for hours. Long-term benefits.

3. AVOID LAYERING: Don't combine dopamine sources (music + pre-workout + caffeine + energy drink). Each individually keeps baseline stable.

4. PROTECT BASELINE: Constant scrolling, gaming, porn → crashed baseline → anhedonia.

My changes:

- Gym without phone
- Cold showers (2-3 min at end)
- No social media first thing in morning
- Caffeine delayed 90-120 min after waking

The goal: Higher baseline, not higher peaks. Peaks create valleys.
