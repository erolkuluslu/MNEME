Core premise:

"The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default."

---

"If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will."

My note: Yes. My calendar fills with others' priorities unless I defend it.

---

On saying no:

"We can either make the hard choices for ourselves or allow others—our bosses, our colleagues, our clients, or even our families—to decide for us."

My note: Every yes is a no to something else. Explicit choices > implicit defaults.

---

On trade-offs:

"Essentialists see trade-offs as an inherent part of life, not as an inherently negative part of life."

My note: Can't do everything. Choosing is not losing—it's focusing.

---

The 90% rule:

"If the answer isn't a definite yes, then it should be a no."

My note: Good enough isn't good enough. Either it's clearly worth doing or it's not.

---

Overall: This book is the antidote to hustle culture's "do everything" message. Less but better. Protect the vital few from the trivial many.
