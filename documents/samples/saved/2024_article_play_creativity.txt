The research:

Companies with "playful" cultures produce more patents. Kids who play more show better problem-solving.

Why play works:

1. REMOVES FEAR: Play is safe. Failure is okay. This enables experimentation.

2. ENCOURAGES EXPLORATION: Play isn't goal-oriented. You stumble onto discoveries.

3. MAKES CONNECTIONS: Play is associative. Ideas combine unexpectedly.

4. RESTORES ENERGY: Play is regenerative. Returns to work fresher.

The problem:

Adults don't play. We "relax" (passive consumption) but don't play (active engagement).

My reflection:

When did I last play? Not consume entertainment—actually play?

The gym is kind of play. Cooking is kind of play. But unstructured play? Rarely.

Experiment: More play. Less consumption.
