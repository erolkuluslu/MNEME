"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

My note: Goals are fine for direction. Systems are what you actually do. Design systems.

---

"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

My note: Identity shapes behavior. Each small choice reinforces identity. I'm not "trying to exercise." I'm "a person who exercises."

---

"The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become."

My note: Not "I want to read more" but "I am a reader." Identity-based change.

---

"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."

My note: 1% daily = 37x yearly. Small things matter.

---

"You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results."

My note: Trajectory > position. Are you heading the right direction?

This book is a manual, not just a read. I keep returning to it.
