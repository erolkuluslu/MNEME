Book 2:

"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

My note: The foundation. Everything else follows.

---

"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

My note: Reading about virtue ≠ being virtuous. Theory ≠ practice. Close the book and act.

---

Book 4:

"Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present."

My note: Anxiety is always about the future. But I'll face the future with the same skills I use today. Worry is unnecessary.

Book 5:

"At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: 'I have to go to work—as a human being.'"

My note: Even the emperor didn't want to get up. The struggle is universal.

---

Book 8:

"If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it."

My note: Simple rule. Hard to follow consistently.

---

Book 12:

"How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks."

My note: Comparison is the thief of joy. Focus inward.

---

Overall: This is my bible. I return to it constantly. Written by a Roman emperor to himself, for his own improvement. Never meant to be published. That's what makes it powerful—pure, unfiltered self-work.
