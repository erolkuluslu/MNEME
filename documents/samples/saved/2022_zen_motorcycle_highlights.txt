"The real cycle you're working on is a cycle called yourself."

My note: Whatever you're building or fixing, you're really working on yourself. The external is a mirror.

"When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things."

My note: The feeling of wanting to rush is diagnostic. It reveals where you don't care. If I want to rush through work, what does that say about my relationship to it?

"We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of sand the world."

My note: Our perception is tiny. We mistake the handful for everything. Humility about what we know.

"The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands."

My note: Don't try to fix the world before fixing yourself. Start where you have control.

"The truth knocks on the door and you say, 'Go away, I'm looking for the truth,' and so it goes away."

My note: We miss what's in front of us while searching for something else.
