This is the recipe I've refined over 5 years. Not just technique—philosophy.

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:

1. Read the dough, not the clock. Temperature affects timing.

2. Gentle handling during shaping. Tension without degassing.

3. The overnight cold proof develops flavor dramatically.

4. Steam (the covered Dutch oven phase) is what makes crust.

5. Patience. Cutting too early releases steam, ruins crumb.

This recipe is a living document. Still tweaking after 5 years. That's the point.
