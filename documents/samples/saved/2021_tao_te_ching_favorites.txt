Verse 1:

"The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name."

My note: Reality exceeds language. The map is not the territory. Humility about what we can know.

Verse 11:

"We join spokes in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move.
We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want."

My note: Negative space. What's NOT there is often more important than what IS there. This applies to design, writing, life.

Verse 76:

"Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard.
Whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death.
Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life."

My note: Flexibility > rigidity. In body, mind, opinions. The stiff branch breaks. The flexible one bends.

Verse 33:

"Knowing others is intelligence;
knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Mastering others is strength;
mastering yourself is true power."

My note: Self-knowledge is the foundation. Self-mastery is the goal.

Overall: The Tao Te Ching is 81 verses of paradox and wisdom. Every read reveals something new. It's a mirror—what you see depends on where you are.
