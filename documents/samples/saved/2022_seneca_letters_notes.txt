Letter II - On Discursiveness in Reading:

"Be careful there is no discursiveness about your reading. The primary indication of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company."

My note: Deep reading > wide reading. This challenges my habit of starting many books, finishing few.

"To be everywhere is to be nowhere."

My note: This is about attention. Scattered attention = no attention.

Letter VII - On Crowds:

"To consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us."

My note: Seneca would have HATED social media. The crowd pulls us toward its average.

---

Letter LXXVIII - On the Healing Power of the Mind:

"It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it."

My note: The problem isn't lifespan. It's how I use it.

Overall: Seneca is more practical than Marcus. Less cosmic, more actionable. His letters feel like advice from a wise friend.
