Key passages:

"Good design is simple. You hear this from math to painting. When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem."

"Good design is hard. Look at the people who've made something great, and you'll find they worked harder than most people can imagine."

"Good design looks easy. Like great athletes, great designers make it look effortless. The work is hidden."

My reflection:

I want to be a craftsman. Not just someone who ships. Someone who ships well.

The tension:

Ship fast vs. ship well. The answer isn't either/or. It's: develop taste so you can do both.

The path to taste:

Exposure. See lots of work. Good and bad. Taste develops through comparison.

Then: Iteration. Make things. Compare to what you admire. Close the gap.
