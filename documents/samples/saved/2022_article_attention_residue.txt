TITLE: Attention Residue - Why Multitasking Fails
AUTHOR: Saved with notes
DATE: 2022-04-10

The concept:

When you switch tasks, attention doesn't instantly switch. A "residue" remains on the previous task.

The study:

People who switched tasks performed worse on subsequent tasks. The residue degraded performance.

Implications:

- Multitasking is attention-splitting, not attention-multiplying
- Each switch has a cost
- Deep work requires sustained focus

The solution:

Batch similar tasks. Minimize switches. Protect focus blocks.

My note:

I feel this. When I check email mid-project, part of my brain stays on email. The project suffers.

Single-tasking isn't less productive. It's more productive because there's no residue.
