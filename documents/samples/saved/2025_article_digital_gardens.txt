What is a digital garden?

Not a blog (chronological). Not a wiki (complete).

A digital garden is:
- Growing, evolving notes
- Public work-in-progress
- Interconnected ideas
- Different "stages" of development (seedling, growing, evergreen)

Why it resonates:

Traditional publishing is polished and finished. Intimidating.

Digital gardens are messy and honest. Learning in public.

Examples:

- Andy Matuschak's notes
- Maggie Appleton's illustrated notes
- Many others

The philosophy:

Ideas need time to develop. A garden is tended, not manufactured. Some plants thrive, others don't.

My reflection:

I've been publishing when things are "done." What if I published earlier?

Benefits:
- Accountability
- Feedback
- Connections with fellow learners
- Documentation of journey

This connects to "learning in public." Same spirit.

Maybe my notes should be a garden, not a vault.
