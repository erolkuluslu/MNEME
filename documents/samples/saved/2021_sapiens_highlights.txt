"Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths."

My note: Money is a myth. Nations are myths. Corporations are myths. That doesn't make them less powerful—myths coordinate behavior.

"Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language."

My note: Not because we're stronger or faster. Because we can communicate complex ideas, plan, coordinate.

"Biology enables, culture forbids."

My note: We can do many things biologically. Culture decides what's acceptable. Culture is the layer on top of biology.

"The Agricultural Revolution was history's biggest fraud."

My note: Farming didn't make life better. Harder work, worse diet, more disease. But population grew. Evolution doesn't optimize for happiness.

---

"Happiness does not really depend on objective conditions... but on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations."

My note: Hedonic treadmill. Expectations rise. Happiness stays constant. The only lasting satisfaction is lowering expectations or finding meaning beyond conditions.

This book made me see humans differently. We're myth-making apes. Everything about society is fiction we collectively believe.
