# Personal Knowledge Bank

> *"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."* — Tiago Forte

This collection represents a **personal digital brain**—a living archive of one person's intellectual, professional, and personal journey from 2020 to 2025. It is designed to demonstrate how a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system can transform scattered notes, highlights, journals, and insights into an **active, organized, and searchable knowledge-building experience** in an age of information overload.

---

## 📚 The Philosophy Behind This Collection

In a world where we consume more information than ever but retain less, this knowledge bank embodies a different approach:

1. **Capture Everything That Resonates** — From book highlights to shower thoughts
2. **Connect Across Domains** — Philosophy informs technology; cooking teaches patience for learning
3. **Revisit and Refine** — Notes grow more valuable through progressive distillation
4. **Build a Second Brain** — Offload storage to focus on synthesis and creativity

The documents here aren't just files—they're **nodes in a personal knowledge graph**, interconnected through themes, ideas, and lived experience.

## 🔗 The Hidden Connections

The true power of this knowledge bank emerges when you see how **different domains inform each other**:

### AI ↔ Philosophy
- `2023_gpt_shock.txt` references the "black box" problem → connects to `2024_tech_ethics.txt` on AI alignment
- `2020_thinking_fast_slow_kahneman.txt` on System 1/2 → explains why LLMs fail at reasoning
- Marcus Aurelius's "Logos" → becomes a metaphor for AI's potential rational order

### Sourdough ↔ Machine Learning
- "You can't rush fermentation" → parallels patience in training neural networks
- Both require feeding, nurturing, and creating conditions for emergence
- `2020_june_starting_ml_journey.txt` explicitly draws this parallel

### Mental Models ↔ Personal Life
- `2024_antifragility_concept.txt` → applied to career and relationship building
- `2022_mise_en_place.txt` → from kitchen prep to workday preparation
- `2020_compound_interest_for_skills.txt` → justifies daily practice in gym and learning

### Japan ↔ Craft ↔ Code
- `2023_may_kyoto_stillness.txt` on "kodawari" → pursuit of perfection in craft
- Tea ceremony's "no wasted motion" → influences code elegance goals
- `2023_kodawari_japanese_craft.txt` connects cultural appreciation to work philosophy

### Knowledge Systems ↔ This Very Project
- `2024_building_second_brain_notes.txt` → "RAG over my second brain = searchable, synthesizable knowledge"
- `2024_zettelkasten_method.txt` → atomic notes with links = this document structure
- `2023_rag_concept_click.txt` → the foundation for the system reading these very documents

## 🌱 Living Knowledge

This isn't a static archive. It represents:

- **233+ documents** across 7 categories
- **5+ years** of lived experience
- **Hundreds of connections** between ideas
- **One person's attempt** to make sense of information overload

The beauty of applying RAG to personal knowledge is that it transforms passive storage into **active retrieval**—surfacing the right knowledge at the right moment, making connections the conscious mind might miss.

In an age where we drown in information but starve for wisdom, this collection demonstrates how thoughtful capture, organization, and retrieval can turn the chaos of modern life into a **personal oracle**—one that knows not just facts, but context, history, and meaning.
