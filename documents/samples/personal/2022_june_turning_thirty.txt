Thirty years old. Three decades on this planet. I don't feel old, but I don't feel young either.

My twenties were chaotic. Career changes. Failed relationships. Cities moved. Identity crisis after crisis. I was figuring out who I am.

Now I know, mostly. I'm a builder. I like making things—code, bread, muscle. I'm introverted but need connection. I'm anxious but managing it. I value depth over breadth.

Physical inventory: Healthier than I've ever been. Bench: 225. Deadlift: 315. Body fat reasonable.

Mental inventory: More stable than my twenties. Stoicism helps. Meditation helps.

Financial inventory: Comfortable. No debt, some savings, a job I don't hate.

Relationship inventory: Single. This one needs work. I've focused so much on self-improvement I've neglected this area.

Goals for my thirties:
- Build something that matters
- Find a partner
- Stay healthy
- Keep learning

Thirty. Let's go.
