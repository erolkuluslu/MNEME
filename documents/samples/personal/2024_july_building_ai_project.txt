Building an AI agent for personal knowledge management. Ambitious. Maybe too ambitious. Learning so much.

The idea: Ask questions about my notes. It retrieves context, synthesizes answers. "What did I learn about Stoicism?" It searches my journal, finds relevant entries, responds.

It's different building with AI. Less deterministic, more probabilistic. Shaping behavior, not dictating it.

The 2020 version of me who struggled with neural networks would be amazed. Or terrified. Both.

Challenges I'm facing: How to chunk documents? How to handle context limits? What makes a good embedding?

But I'm making progress. Each iteration is slightly better. Progressive overload for code.
