Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive metagenomic analysis of microbial communities in artisanal sourdough starters from 15 countries. We identified 234 unique bacterial species and 47 yeast species, revealing complex ecological relationships that determine bread flavor, texture, and rise.

1. Introduction

Sourdough fermentation represents one of humanity's oldest biotechnologies, dating back over 5,000 years. Unlike commercial baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), sourdough relies on a symbiotic community of wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB).

The traditional view held that Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida milleri dominated sourdough ecosystems. Our metagenomic approach reveals far greater diversity and complexity.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Sample Collection: 127 mature sourdough starters (>6 months old) were collected from artisan bakeries across 15 countries.

2.2 DNA Extraction: Total microbial DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen).

2.3 Sequencing: 16S rRNA (bacteria) and ITS (fungi) amplicon sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq 6000.

2.4 Bioinformatics: QIIME2 pipeline with SILVA (bacteria) and UNITE (fungi) databases.

3. Results

3.1 Bacterial Diversity
- Dominant genera: Lactobacillus (67%), Pediococcus (12%), Leuconostoc (8%)
- Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis: present in 89% of samples
- Novel species: 12 potentially new Lactobacillus species identified

3.2 Yeast Diversity  
- Dominant genera: Kazachstania (41%), Saccharomyces (28%), Candida (19%)
- Kazachstania humilis (formerly C. milleri): most common yeast
- Geographic variation: European starters showed 2.3x more yeast diversity

3.3 Ecological Relationships
- Strong positive correlation between L. sanfranciscensis and K. humilis (r=0.73)
- Competitive exclusion between S. cerevisiae and wild yeasts
- Temperature-dependent community shifts: >28°C favors homofermentative LAB

4. Flavor Compound Analysis

GC-MS analysis revealed:
- Acetic acid: correlated with Acetobacter presence (sour, vinegar notes)
- Ethyl acetate: produced by yeast metabolism (fruity notes)
- 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl): buttery aroma from LAB
- 3-methyl-1-butanol: complex fermentation byproduct

5. Discussion

The complexity of sourdough microbiomes rivals that of other fermented foods like kimchi and kombucha. Home bakers can influence their starter's character through:
- Temperature control (cooler = milder, warmer = more sour)
- Hydration level (higher = more acetic acid)
- Flour type (whole grain = more diverse microbiome)

6. Conclusion

Sourdough starters are complex, dynamic ecosystems. Understanding their microbiology enables bakers to achieve consistent, reproducible results while maintaining the artisanal character that distinguishes sourdough from commercial bread.
