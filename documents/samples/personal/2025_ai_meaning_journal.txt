What does meaning mean when AI can do my job?

The question keeps me up at night. I've spent years building skills. AI can now do much of it. Better? Sometimes. Faster? Almost always.

Where does that leave me?

Current thinking:

1. JUDGMENT STILL MATTERS: AI generates options. Humans choose. Taste, values, context—still human.

2. RELATIONSHIPS STILL MATTER: Clients want to talk to people. Trust is interpersonal.

3. THE PROCESS STILL MATTERS: I code partly for the output, partly for the satisfaction. The doing is meaningful, not just the result.

4. NEW OPPORTUNITIES EMERGE: AI enables things that weren't possible. I can build more, faster. That's exciting.

5. MEANING ISN'T JUST PRODUCTIVITY: Even if AI did everything, I'd still have relationships, experiences, growth, curiosity.

The worry: Am I rationalizing? Will I feel differently when AI is better?

The resolve: Keep building. Keep learning. Adapt. The path forward is through, not around.

Viktor Frankl found meaning in Auschwitz. Surely I can find it in a world with helpful AI.
