TITLE: Two Years of Consistent Lifting - The Compound Effect

Consistency is king. I looked at my training logs from 2022. I was deadlifting 315 lbs then. Today I pulled 405 lbs. It took two years of showing up, week after week. No magic pill. No shortcuts. Just gravity and effort.

The gym remains my anchor. When the code is broken, when the AI is hallucinating, when the world is chaotic, 405 lbs is always 405 lbs. It doesn't lie. It doesn't care about my feelings. It just demands respect.

I've learned to love the plateau. In 2022, I would get frustrated if I didn't hit a PR every week. Now I know that strength is built in the quiet periods where nothing seems to be happening. You are adapting. Your CNS is learning. And then, suddenly, you break through. It's exactly like learning a hard concept in programming. You struggle for weeks, and then one day, it just clicks.

The progressive overload principle I read about has become second nature. Small increments. Track everything. Trust the process. It's the same in code, in bread, in life. You can't force growth; you can only create the conditions for it and show up consistently.

My squat is up to 365, bench to 275. Not elite numbers, but respectable. More importantly, I feel strong. At 35, I'm in better shape than I was at 25. That's the real PR.
