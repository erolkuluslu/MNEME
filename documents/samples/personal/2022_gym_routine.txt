Hit a PR on deadlifts today. 315 lbs. Felt heavy, but moved smooth. The gym is the one place where effort equals results linearly. You put in the work, you get stronger. No bugs, no compile errors, no ambiguous client requirements. Just gravity. It keeps me sane.

I've been tracking my macros too. Protein intake is key. It's interesting how the body is a machine, distinct from the mind but fueling it. When I eat trash, my code is trash. When I sleep well and lift heavy, I can solve problems that stumped me the day before.

There's a meditative quality to lifting. You have to be present. If your mind wanders during a heavy squat, you get crushed. It forces mindfulness. In a world where my attention is fractured by a dozen tabs and Slack channels, that hour of singular focus is precious.

I'm trying to apply the concept of progressive overload to my life. Small, incremental improvements. 1% better every day. It compounds. Just like the weights on the bar. It's not about the big leap; it's about showing up. Consistency. That's the secret sauce. In the gym, and in code.

It's also about recovery. You don't grow in the gym; you grow when you sleep. I used to think pulling all-nighters was a badge of honor. Now I realize it's just borrowing happiness from tomorrow. I need to respect the recovery phase. In training, and in work. Rest is not idleness. It's part of the process.
