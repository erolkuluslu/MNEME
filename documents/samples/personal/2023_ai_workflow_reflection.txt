TITLE: How AI Changed My Daily Work
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2023-09-20

Six months of heavy AI use. Time to reflect on what's changed.

What AI does for me now:
- First drafts of documentation
- Explaining unfamiliar code
- Generating boilerplate
- Debugging help
- Brainstorming ideas
- Refactoring suggestions

What I still do:
- Architecture decisions
- Code review (including AI's code)
- Understanding requirements
- Communicating with humans
- Final judgment calls

The unexpected change: I read more code than I write. AI writes, I review. I've become an editor.

The skill shift: Prompt engineering is real. Knowing how to ask is as important as knowing how to do.

The worry: Am I getting worse at coding from scratch? Use it or lose it?

The balance: I force myself to code without AI sometimes. Keep the muscle.

Overall: Massive productivity gain. But I'm vigilant about atrophy.
