Taught neural network concepts to summer interns today. Full circle.

Five years ago, I was them. Confused. Frustrated. Staring at error messages that made no sense.

Today, I explained the concepts I once struggled with. They nodded. Asked good questions.

I told them about my 2020 struggles. The debugging nights. The imposter syndrome. They seemed relieved senior engineers were once clueless too.

The field changed. In 2020, what I was learning was cutting edge. Now it's foundational, superseded by newer things. But fundamentals remain. Understanding still matters.

I encouraged them: build something from scratch. At least once. Feel the concepts.

Teaching clarifies your knowledge. Explaining reveals gaps.

Mentorship feels good. Paying forward what others gave me.
