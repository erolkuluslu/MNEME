TITLE: The Exhausting World of Dating Apps

October 5, 2022.

Redownloaded the dating apps. Hinge, Bumble. My thirties resolution was to find a partner. Can't do that from my couch.

It's exhausting. The swiping. The opening lines. Conversations that fizzle after three messages. The ghosting.

Went on two dates this month. Both fine. Neither clicked. The apps gamify connection. They reduce humans to profiles and prompts. "My most controversial opinion is..." "I'm convinced that..." Performative.

But what's the alternative? I work from home half the week. My hobbies are solo—gym, baking, coding. Where do I meet people?

I've been reading Gottman's research on successful marriages. The importance of friendship as foundation. The 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

For now, I keep swiping. Keep showing up. Something has to work eventually.

Right?
