TITLE: First Real PR - Benching 185

Valentine's Day. Single. But I got a PR at the gym. Benched 185 lbs for 3 reps. Almost my body weight.

The feeling is indescribable. The bar felt heavy, but my body knew what to do. Tight back, leg drive, controlled descent, explosive push. Last rep was a grind but I got it.

Progressive overload works. It's not complicated. Add a little weight or a few reps each week. Show up consistently. The body adapts. Almost algorithmic.

I've been thinking about how this applies elsewhere. Learning to code was progressive overload. Simple programs, then complex ones, then systems. Each challenge slightly beyond current ability.

Marcus Aurelius talked about this too. "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." The gym version: Stop researching the perfect program. Just lift and progress.

Celebrating with a protein shake and a book. Most romantic Valentine's I've had in years.
