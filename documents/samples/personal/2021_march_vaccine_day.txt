TITLE: Got Vaccinated - Light at the End

April 15, 2021.

Got vaccinated today. Pfizer, first dose. I almost cried in the CVS parking lot. After 13 months of isolation, there's a way out.

The process was surreal. Driving to a pharmacy to get injected with mRNA technology developed in record time. A year ago, this vaccine didn't exist. Now it's in my arm, training my cells to recognize spike proteins.

I read about the mRNA technology. It's brilliant. Instead of giving you a weakened virus, it gives your cells instructions to build one protein. Your immune system learns from the blueprint. No virus needed.

The timeline was insane. Normally vaccines take 10-15 years. This one took 11 months. What else could we achieve with that level of focus and funding? Climate change? Cancer? I wonder.

Second dose in three weeks. Then two weeks to full protection. Then maybe, finally, life can resume.
