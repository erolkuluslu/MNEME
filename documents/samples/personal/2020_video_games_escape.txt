Sunk 50 hours into Cyberpunk 2077. The bugs are bad, but Night City is incredible. I find myself driving around, listening to synthwave radio.

It's pure escapism. Leveling up. Hacking terminals. Getting better loot. The dopamine loop of effort → reward.

But it's fake effort. I'm not actually achieving anything.

I need to be careful. Easy to lose days in virtual worlds. Easier than the real world. In the game, I'm a hero. In reality, I'm stuck in my apartment during a pandemic.

Games are fine in moderation. But they can become a crutch. A way to avoid the hard work of real achievement.

Time to set limits. The sourdough starter needs feeding. The neural network needs debugging. Night City can wait.
