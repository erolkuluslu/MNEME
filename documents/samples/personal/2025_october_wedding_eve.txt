Tomorrow I get married.

I'm in a hotel room. Maya is at another hotel. Tradition. We texted goodnight. "See you at the altar."

I'm thinking about the journey. The lonely nights of 2020. The gym sessions processing emotions. The meditation sits confronting fears. The Japan trips expanding my world. The sourdough teaching patience.

All of it led here.

I'm thinking about the people who helped. Jake, who gave me Marcus Aurelius. My therapist. My parents. Maya, who loved me when I was still learning to love myself.

The Stoics talk about "amor fati." Love of fate. I love my fate. Even the hard parts. Especially the hard parts.

I'm scared. Marriage is a leap. You promise forever in a world where nothing is forever. But the leap is the point. You choose despite uncertainty.

Tomorrow I choose Maya. She chooses me. We leap together.

See you at the altar.
