TITLE: Back in the Gym - Starting Over

June 20, 2021.

The gyms reopened. I went back today. It was humbling.

15 months ago I was benching 135 comfortably. Today I struggled with 95. My squat dropped from 185 to 115. I have the strength of a college freshman again.

The pandemic took more than time. It took my fitness, my momentum, my confidence. I look in the mirror and see someone I don't recognize.

But I showed up. That's the first step. Baseline numbers: Bench 95 lbs, Squat 115 lbs, Deadlift 135 lbs, Pull-ups: 0 (literally zero).

The program is simple. Three days a week. Full body. Focus on form, not weight. "Leave your ego at the door." I have no ego left to leave.

Progressive overload. Add a little weight each week. Be consistent. The body adapts. It's not complicated. Just hard.

The gym is the one place where effort equals results linearly. No ambiguity. No politics. Just physics. I need that clarity right now.

Day 1 of rebuilding. Let's see where this goes.
