Flew to Portland for a long weekend. First real trip since 2019. The freedom of being in a new place. Walking new streets. Eating new food.

Highlights:
- Powell's City of Books: Three floors. An entire city block of books. Lost for three hours. Bought "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."
- Stumptown Coffee: The original location. Pilgrimage complete.
- Screen Door: Chicken and waffles. Absurd.
- Afuri Ramen: Yuzu shio, light and bright.

Travel resets the brain. At home, I fall into ruts. Same coffee shop, same gym, same routes. Here, everything is novel. Every corner could be interesting.

I talked to strangers. At the bar. At the bookstore. Random humans with random stories. The pandemic made me forget how to do this. It's medicine.

Note to self: travel more. Even short trips. Even alone. Especially alone.
