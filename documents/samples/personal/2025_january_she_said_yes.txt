January 1, 2025.

She said yes.

The rooftop was freezing. Champagne too cold. Fireworks too loud for my speech. None of it mattered.

When I got on one knee, she started crying before I said anything. "Yes. Yes. Yes."

Called our families. Mom screamed. Her mom cried. We stayed on the roof, shivering, watching the city celebrate.

The ring fit. The selfie is blurry. It's now my phone background.

Today we're fiancés. What a word.

The future is terrifying and exciting. Wedding planning. Maybe kids someday.

Four years ago: alone, baking sad bread in a pandemic apartment. Now: building a life with someone I love.

The journey matters. The growth matters. The suffering that led here.

She said yes.
