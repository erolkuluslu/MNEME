TITLE: Failed My First Sourdough Starter

April 4, 2020.

The sourdough starter is a disaster. It's been a week and it just smells like vinegar and sadness. I think I let it ferment too long in the warm cupboard. The internet says it should smell yeasty and pleasant. Mine smells like something died in a brewery.

Unlike my coding projects, this is biological. It's messy. It's alive (or supposed to be). I named it 'Doughvid-19' which is in poor taste but I need the humor right now.

The world outside is getting worse. Cases climbing. Death counts reported like sports scores. I refresh the news obsessively, then hate myself for it.

The starter got thrown out. I'll try again tomorrow. Fresh jar. Clean spoon. More patience. It's not like I have anywhere to be.

Watched three YouTube videos on sourdough microbiology. The yeast and lactobacillus form a symbiotic relationship. It's elegant, really. If only I could create the right conditions for that elegance to emerge.
