TITLE: Is AI Making Me Less Creative?
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2025-03-10

Uncomfortable question I'm sitting with:

Is using AI for everything making me less capable on my own?

The concern:

I don't code from scratch anymore. I don't struggle with blank pages. AI provides starting points for everything.

What's being lost? The wrestling. The frustration that leads to breakthroughs. The muscle built through difficulty.

Counter-argument:

Tools have always changed work. Calculators didn't make us worse at math (maybe). Writing didn't weaken memory (okay, maybe it did).

The resolution (for now):

Intentionally do things the hard way sometimes. Keep the muscles active. Use AI as amplifier, not replacement.

And watch carefully. If I can't think without AI, that's a problem.

The meta-question: What skills do I want to preserve? Those get protected. The rest can be augmented.
