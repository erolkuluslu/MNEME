TITLE: Experimenting with High Hydration
AUTHOR: Me

Pushed to 80% hydration today. The dough was a nightmare to handle—slack, sticky, wants to spread rather than hold shape.

But the crumb! Open and irregular. Holes you could see through. The texture: chewy, moist, almost custard-like near the big holes.

The technique changes at high hydration. More stretches and folds. Gentle handling during shaping. Strong bench flour game. Accept that it won't look perfect going into the oven.

It's counterintuitive. Less handling = better structure. The gluten develops through time and folds, not aggressive kneading.

I've been baking for over two years now. The learning never stops. Just when I think I've "figured it out," I find a new technique, a new variable, a new way to fail.

That's what I love about it.
