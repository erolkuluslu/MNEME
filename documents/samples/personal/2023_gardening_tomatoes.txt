TITLE: Growing Tomatoes - Lessons in Patience

The tomato plants are going crazy. I planted 'Cherokee Purple' and 'Sun Gold'. I need to prune the suckers to encourage fruit production. The soil pH was a bit low, so I added some lime.

Gardening is different from baking. Baking is chemistry; gardening is ecology. You have to deal with pests. Aphids. Hornworms. I released some ladybugs to eat the aphids. Biological warfare in my backyard.

There is something satisfying about eating a tomato you grew yourself. It tastes like sunshine. Store-bought tomatoes are cardboard. I'm learning about companion planting. Basil helps repel insects. Marigolds are good too. It's a whole system.

Like sourdough, gardening forces patience. You can't rush a tomato. You plant, you water, you wait. The feedback loop is weeks, not seconds. In a world of instant gratification, that's a valuable lesson.

The garden is also teaching me about failure. Lost half my cucumber plants to powdery mildew. Could have prevented it with better spacing. Every failure is data. Next year I'll do better.
