TITLE: Japan With Maya - Sharing What I Love
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2024-10-12

October 12, 2024.

Took Maya to Japan. Ten days. Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka. Sharing my favorite country with my favorite person.

Different the second time. Through her eyes, I saw it fresh. Her first matcha. First bullet train. First temple silence.

We stayed at a ryokan together. First shared onsen. Awkward and intimate.

We talked about living abroad someday. Maybe a year in Kyoto. Remote work. A dream, but shared now.

Travel stress-tested us. Missed trains. Wrong turns. Hangry moments. We passed. Navigated together. Laughed at mishaps.

I think I'm going to marry her.
