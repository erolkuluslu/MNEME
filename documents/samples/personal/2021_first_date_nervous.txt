TITLE: First Date Nerves

First date from Hinge tonight. Sarah. Graphic designer. Likes hiking.

I'm nervous. Haven't dated in over a year. Forgot how to do this.

The date: Coffee, then a walk if it's going well. Low stakes. Easy exit if needed.

What I'm worried about:
- Awkward silences
- Running out of things to say
- Being too nervous to be myself
- Her being disappointed in person

What I'm telling myself:
- Just be curious about her
- It's just coffee
- She's probably nervous too
- Rejection isn't death

Update (after):

It was... fine? Nice person. Conversation flowed okay. But no spark. We hugged goodbye.

Is this what dating is? Lots of "fine" until something clicks?

Keep showing up. That's the plan.
