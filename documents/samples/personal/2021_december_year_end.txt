TITLE: 2021 Year in Review

December 31, 2021.

A better year. Not hard to beat 2020, but still.

Physical: Down 8 lbs from peak pandemic weight. Gym consistency building. I can do 5 pull-ups now (from 0). Bench up to 145.

Mental: Meditation streak hit 200 days before breaking. Stoicism is becoming a practice. I catch myself spiraling and apply the dichotomy of control. Sometimes it works.

Work: Promoted to senior engineer. Imposter syndrome loud but manageable. Shipped a major feature without burning out.

Hobbies: Sourdough is reliable now. Started learning guitar in December. My fingers hurt.

Social: Saw friends in person. Hugged my parents. Attended a wedding. Human contact is not optional.

Books: 18 read. Favorites: "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius, "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Kahneman.

Goals for 2022:
- Bench press body weight (need 40 more lbs on the bar)
- Ship a side project
- Read 24 books
- Travel somewhere international

The trajectory is good. Keep climbing.
