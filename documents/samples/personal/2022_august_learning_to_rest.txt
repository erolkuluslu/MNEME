Pushed too hard. Minor shoulder strain from bench pressing. Nothing serious, but enough to sideline me for two weeks.

The trainer talked about deload weeks. Periods of reduced intensity for recovery. I knew this intellectually but didn't practice it. More is always better, right? Wrong.

The body needs rest to grow. Muscles don't strengthen during the workout; they strengthen during recovery. Sleep. Nutrition. Time.

This applies to mental work too. I've been grinding at work—late nights, weekend debugging. Shipped the feature but I'm fried. Creativity gone. Making dumb mistakes.

Cal Newport calls this deep work vs. shallow work. But even deep work needs breaks. The brain consolidates during rest. Archimedes had his eureka in the bath.

New policy:
- Gym: Every 4th week, reduce weight by 40%
- Work: One day per week with no meetings
- Life: One weekend per month with no obligations

Rest is not weakness. Rest is strategy.
