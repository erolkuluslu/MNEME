TITLE: What Bread Taught Me About Life

June 20, 2025.

Five years of sourdough. Time for reflection.

What bread taught me:

1. PATIENCE: You cannot rush fermentation. Some things take time. Relationships. Careers. Skills.

2. ATTENTION: The dough tells you what it needs. You must listen. In a world of distraction, attention is rare.

3. FAILURE: Every baker has disasters. Failure is data. The fear of failure is worse than failure.

4. SIMPLICITY: Flour, water, salt, time. Four ingredients. Infinite variation. The best things are simple done well.

5. GENEROSITY: Bread is meant to be shared. So is knowledge. So is love.

The starter from 2020 is still alive. It survived moves. Neglect. Refrigerator hibernation. A living archive of my pandemic.

Maya and I are making our wedding bread. Our recipe. Our starter. Our hands.

Full circle.
