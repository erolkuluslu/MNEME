One month until the wedding. The nerves are real.

Not about Maya—I've never been more certain about anything. But about the event itself. The attention. The expectations. The "what ifs."

What if I fumble my vows?
What if the weather ruins the outdoor ceremony?
What if the caterer fails?
What if people don't have fun?

Stoic intervention: Which of these are in my control?

My vows: Yes. I can practice. And if I fumble, it's human. Maya will understand.

The weather: No. We have a backup plan. Accept the possibility.

The caterer: Partially. We vetted them. Beyond that, acceptance.

People's fun: No. I can create conditions. Their experience is theirs.

The dichotomy of control, applied to wedding planning. Marcus Aurelius would approve.

Deep breath. We've done the work. The details are handled. The vendor checklist is green.

What matters is the commitment. Two people choosing each other. The rest is decoration.

But damn, I still hope it doesn't rain.
