Downloaded Headspace. Everyone says meditation helps with anxiety. I have plenty of that. The news is relentless. Cases. Deaths. Politics. My brain won't stop.

First session was 10 minutes. It felt like an hour. My mind wandered to work tasks, the starter that needs feeding, that embarrassing thing I said in 2015, what if I get COVID, did I lock the door...

The instructor said wandering is normal. "When you notice your mind wandering, gently bring it back to the breath." I noticed approximately 847 times.

But there was a moment—maybe 30 seconds—where I was just... present. No thoughts. Just breathing. Like finding a quiet room in a noisy house. Then I thought "Hey, I'm meditating!" and ruined it.

I'm committing to 30 days. 10 minutes each morning before checking the news. Let's see if anything changes.

The Stoics wrote about this. Marcus Aurelius trained his attention, focused on what he could control. Maybe meditation is the practical application of Stoicism.
