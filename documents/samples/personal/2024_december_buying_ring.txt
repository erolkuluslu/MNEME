December 1, 2024.

I bought a ring. It's in my sock drawer, wrapped in a T-shirt. Every time I open that drawer, my heart rate spikes.

The plan: New Year's Eve. Rooftop of our building. Champagne. Fireworks. The question.

Talked to her dad. Traditional, but felt right. He gave his blessing. "Finally. We've been waiting."

I've practiced the speech. In the mirror. In the shower. During runs. The words matter.

The fear is real. What if she says no? What if it's too soon?

But I don't think I'm misreading. We talk about the future constantly. "When we have kids..." She uses "we" without hesitation.

Marcus Aurelius: "Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present."

I'm armed with love.

Thirty days.
