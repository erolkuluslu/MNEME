TITLE: Escaping into Cyberpunk - Pandemic Escapism
AUTHOR: Me

December 28, 2020.

I've sunk 100 hours into Cyberpunk 2077. The bugs are bad, but the city is incredible. Night City feels alive. I find myself just driving around, listening to the synthwave radio.

It's pure escapism. I'm leveling up my character, hacking terminals, getting better loot. It triggers that dopamine loop. Effort -> Reward. But it's fake effort. I'm not actually achieving anything.

I need to be careful. It's easy to lose days in these virtual worlds. It's easier than the real world. In the game, I'm a hero. In the real world, I'm just a guy stuck in his apartment during a pandemic. But I need to unplug. Real life is where the real loot is.

The irony isn't lost on me. I'm wrestling with CNNs by day, trying to understand machine learning. By night, I'm in a game about AI and corporate dystopia. The themes hit differently now.

Games are fine in moderation. But they can become a crutch. A way to avoid the hard work of real achievement. Time to set some limits. The sourdough starter needs feeding. The neural network needs debugging. Night City can wait.
