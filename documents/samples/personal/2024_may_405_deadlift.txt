TITLE: Four Plate Deadlift - 405 lbs

Four plates. 405 pounds. The goal I've chased for two years.

The gym was crowded. I usually hate that, but today I wanted witnesses. Loaded the bar. Four 45s each side.

Chalked hands. Set stance. Breath. Brace. Pull.

Slow. Painfully slow. Face red. Legs shaking. Bar crawling up. Lockout. Hold. Drop.

I yelled. In Planet Fitness. Didn't care.

The numbers:
- Sept 2021: 135 lbs (starting)
- Feb 2022: 225 lbs
- June 2022: 315 lbs
- Jan 2024: 365 lbs
- May 2024: 405 lbs

Progressive overload works. Show up. Add weight. Trust the process.

Maya recorded it. We celebrated with steak. Protein to rebuild.

New goal: 500 lbs. Seems impossible. But 405 seemed impossible once too.
