TITLE: Finally Seeing My Parents
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2021-07-04

My parents visited for the first time since Christmas 2019. Eighteen months without seeing them in person.

The moment I hugged my mom, I cried. Not a tear or two—full crying. A year and a half of suppressed fear and loneliness came out in that embrace.

We barbecued. We watched fireworks. We talked about nothing important and everything important.

Mom looked older. It hit me suddenly—she ages when I'm not looking. The pandemic stole time with them I can't get back.

Dad showed me his vaccine card like a trophy. "Double-dosed," he said proudly. We clinked beers.

I showed them my sourdough. Mom was genuinely impressed. "My son the baker." She said it like I'd won an award.

The visit was only three days. Not enough. But it was everything.

Some things you don't appreciate until they're gone. Family visits were always "routine." Now I know they're sacred.
