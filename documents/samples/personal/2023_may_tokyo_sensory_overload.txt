I'm in Tokyo. Day 3. My brain is melting from stimulation.

First impression: It's clean. Impossibly clean. No litter. No graffiti. There are vending machines everywhere selling everything.

Second impression: The politeness is real. Everyone bows. "Irasshaimase!" in every shop. It makes American customer service seem barbaric.

Highlights:
- Tsukiji at 6am. Fresh sushi for breakfast. Tuna melted on my tongue.
- Shibuya crossing at night. Hundreds of people flowing like water.
- A tiny 8-seat ramen shop. No English menu. I pointed at a picture. Best ramen of my life.
- Akihabara's neon fever dream. Anime everywhere.

The trains are a marvel. Punctual to the second. Clean. Quiet. Everyone respects the silence.

I feel like I'm in the future. Technology integrated seamlessly. But also ancient traditions preserved—temples, tea ceremonies.

Tomorrow: Kyoto.
