Kyoto is the antidote to Tokyo. Where Tokyo is fast, Kyoto is slow. Where Tokyo is neon, Kyoto is wood and paper.

Staying in a traditional ryokan. Tatami mats. Onsen. Kaiseki dinner. Every detail intentional. The way they pour tea. The arrangement of dishes. Nothing is accidental.

Spent two hours in a Zen rock garden at Ryoan-ji. Just sitting. Watching light change. Monks raked gravel in patterns. I thought about nothing and everything.

The concept of "ma"—negative space—is everywhere. Not what's there; what's not there. The pause between words. The empty space in a painting.

I went to a matcha tea ceremony. An hour of ritual for one bowl of tea. Precise movements. No wasted motion. "Kodawari"—the relentless pursuit of perfection in craft.

This is what I want in my work. Not just functional code, but elegant code. Not just working products, but crafted products.

I'm taking so many notes. This trip is becoming a philosophy lesson.
