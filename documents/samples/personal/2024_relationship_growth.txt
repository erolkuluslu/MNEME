A year of living together. What I've learned about relationships:

1. SMALL GESTURES MATTER: Making coffee for her. Leaving notes. The little things add up.

2. REPAIR IS EVERYTHING: We fight. Everyone does. What matters is repair. Apologize. Reconnect. Don't let resentment build.

3. INDEPENDENCE WITHIN TOGETHERNESS: We need our own friends, hobbies, time alone. Being together all the time isn't healthy.

4. COMMUNICATION IS A SKILL: "I feel" statements. Not attacking. Listening before responding. We're still learning.

5. GROWTH ISN'T AUTOMATIC: Relationships don't coast. They need investment. Date nights. Conversations. Intentionality.

Maya makes me better. She challenges my blind spots. Celebrates my wins. Supports my struggles.

I hope I do the same for her.

The Stoics say external things can't make you happy. But partnership isn't external—it's collaborative meaning-making.

I'm happy. Not because of her. But with her.
