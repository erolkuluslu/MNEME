TITLE: In a Reading Slump

I haven't finished a book in two months. I used to read 2-3 books a month. Now I start books and abandon them.

Diagnosis: Phone addiction. Doomscrolling. Short-form content destroying my attention span.

The books pile up: half-read, abandoned. I feel guilty. Reading was part of my identity.

What I'm trying:
1. Phone out of bedroom
2. Kindle only, no iPad (too many distractions)
3. Reading time scheduled (7-8pm, non-negotiable)
4. Re-read old favorites (low friction)
5. Audiobooks for commute/gym

Started re-reading "Meditations." It's like visiting an old friend. The concepts are familiar, but I see new things each time.

Cal Newport would say this is exactly the problem. Deep reading requires protection from shallow distractions.

I'm fighting for my attention span. It's the most valuable resource in the information age. And I've been giving it away for free.

Time to reclaim it.
