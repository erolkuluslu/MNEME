TITLE: I Met Someone - Her Name is Maya

August 14, 2023.

I met someone. Her name is Maya. Matched on Hinge three weeks ago. Four dates. I'm trying not to get ahead of myself, but... I'm excited.

She's a UX designer at a health tech startup. She asks good questions. Laughs at my jokes (even the bad ones). She grew up in Colorado, loves hiking. She has a sourdough starter too. We compared crumb shots.

The conversation flows. No awkward silences. We talked for three hours on our first date. Felt like 30 minutes.

I'm being vulnerable, which is terrifying. Telling her about my anxiety. My Stoicism practice. The stuff I usually hide. But Brené Brown says vulnerability is the birthplace of connection.

She asked about Japan. I talked for 20 minutes. She didn't glaze over. She wants to go someday.

I'm trying not to project a future onto someone I've known for three weeks. Stay present. Enjoy what's here.

But this feels different.
