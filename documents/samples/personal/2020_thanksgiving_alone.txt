First Thanksgiving without family. CDC said don't travel. My parents are in their 60s. I can't risk it.

Video-called during their dinner. Mom held up the phone so I could see everyone at the table. My niece waved. Dad carved the turkey. I felt like a ghost watching the living.

I made a small turkey breast. Roasted vegetables. Mashed potatoes. Ate alone at my desk watching The Great British Baking Show. It was fine. Everything is fine.

The sourdough loaf I baked yesterday was actually great. Best one yet. Crusty, tangy, beautiful crumb. Sent photos to mom. "My son the baker!" Small victories.

I'm grateful for what I have. A job. Health. A roof. Internet. So many people are suffering more. But loneliness is its own suffering. It sneaks up on you in quiet moments. In the space between video calls.

I'll see them next year. In person. Hugs. The whole thing. This is temporary. It has to be temporary.
