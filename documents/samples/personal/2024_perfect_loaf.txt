TITLE: Finally Mastering Sourdough - Four Years Later

Finally mastered the fermentation. The ear on this loaf was magnificent—a crisp, dark ridge that sings when you cut into it. It teaches patience, unlike coding where I expect instant feedback. With bread, you have to wait. You have to feel the dough. It's tactile.

I've moved to a 75% hydration recipe which is sticky but yields such an open crumb. My friends love it. It's funny how a hobby started in desperation during the pandemic has become a meditation. I think about the yeast eating the sugars, a slow biological algorithm executing its code over hours.

There is a rhythm to it now. Autolyse. Mix. Fold. Rest. Fold. Rest. Bulk ferment. Shape. Proof. Bake. It's a ritual. I don't even need the timer anymore; I can tell by the way the dough jiggles if it's ready. It's intuition, built on four years of failure and small successes.

I realize now that the "failures" of 2020 were just data points. I learned what over-proofed dough feels like (slack, sticky). I learned what under-proofed dough looks like (dense, gummy). I couldn't have baked this loaf today without those disasters. It's the same with everything, I suppose. Mastery isn't avoiding failure; it's metabolizing it. The bread tastes better because I know what went into it. Time. Attention. And a little bit of love.

I'm thinking of trying ancient grains next. Spelt. Einkorn. Going back to the roots. There is something deeply human about baking bread. It connects me to thousands of years of history. Every civilization has had bread. It's the staff of life. And in this high-tech, AI-driven world, breaking bread feels like a radical act of humanity.
