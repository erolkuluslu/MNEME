SUCCESS. The second starter is alive. Doubling every 4-6 hours. Smells like beer and happiness. I've been feeding it religiously—same time every day, 1:1:1 ratio.

I documented everything this time. Room temperature: 72-75°F. Feeding schedule: Every 12 hours. The whole wheat seems to help. More wild yeast on the bran.

I attempted my first loaf. It... kind of worked? Not a hockey puck this time, but still dense. The crust was too pale. I think my oven doesn't get hot enough. Need to preheat longer.

The meditative aspect of baking is real. You can't check email while kneading. You can't doomscroll while shaping. Your hands are covered in flour. You have to be present.

In a world that feels out of control, this tiny jar of bubbling goo is something I can nurture. Something I can influence. That matters more than it should.
