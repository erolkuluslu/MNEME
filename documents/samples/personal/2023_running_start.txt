Started running. I've always hated running. "Boring." "Bad for knees." "I'm a gym person."

But I needed cardio. And Maya is a runner. And I wanted to understand why people love it.

First run: 1 mile. Took 12 minutes. Walked parts. Felt like death.

Week 2: 1.5 miles. Still slow. Still hating it.

Week 4: Something shifted. I found a rhythm. Breathing synced with footfalls. Mind went quiet. The "runner's high" everyone talks about—I glimpsed it.

Now: 3 miles, three times a week. Not fast. Not far. But consistent.

What I've learned:
1. Start slower than you think
2. Good shoes matter (finally upgraded)
3. Podcasts and audiobooks make the time fly
4. The first 10 minutes always suck, then it gets easier
5. The mental benefits outweigh the physical

Running is moving meditation. No phone. No notifications. Just breath and pavement.

The gym builds muscle. Running builds mental resilience. Different tools, complementary effects.
