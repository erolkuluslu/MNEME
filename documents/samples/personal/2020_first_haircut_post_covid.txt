TITLE: First Haircut in 14 Months
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2021-05-02

Got my first professional haircut since March 2020. Fourteen months of pandemic hair, gone.

It sounds trivial. It's not. It represents the return to normal. Human services. Physical proximity without fear. A barber touching my head without us both wondering about aerosols.

The barber was wearing a mask. I was wearing a mask. But the shop was open. The chair was warm. The clippers buzzed. It felt like civilization recovering.

I looked in the mirror afterward and saw someone I recognized again. The wild man who lived through COVID was gone. A cleaned-up version emerged.

Small rituals matter. The haircut. The coffee from a real shop. The gym. These are the building blocks of a life. The pandemic stripped them away. Now they return, one by one.

I'm not taking these things for granted anymore.
