TITLE: Recognizing Burnout

I've been burned out for months without realizing it.

Signs I missed:
- Dreading work every morning
- Constant fatigue even after sleep
- Short-tempered with colleagues
- No interest in side projects
- Cynicism about everything

I thought I was just tired. Or that work was "going through a rough patch." I didn't connect the dots.

The turning point: I couldn't bring myself to open VS Code. Stared at the icon for 30 minutes. Eventually gave up and took a walk.

On that walk, I admitted it: I'm burned out.

Recovery plan:
1. Talk to manager. Set boundaries.
2. Take PTO. Actually disconnect.
3. Say no to new projects.
4. Prioritize sleep and exercise.
5. Revisit values. Why did I become an engineer?

The gym helps. The bread helps. The Stoics help. But I need to address the root cause: saying yes to everything, never protecting my time.

Burnout is not weakness. It's a signal. I'm finally listening.
