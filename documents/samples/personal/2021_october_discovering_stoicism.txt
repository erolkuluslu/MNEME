My friend Jake gave me a copy of "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius. He said it helped him through his divorce. I was skeptical. Philosophy? Self-help for ancient Romans? But I trust Jake.

I read the first few pages. Then read them again. Something clicked.

"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

So simple. So hard. I spend so much energy worrying about things I can't control. The news. Other people's opinions. Traffic. Weather. The pandemic. None of it responds to my worry.

What can I control? My reactions. My effort. My character. That's it. Everything else is outside the fence.

The concept of "memento mori" hit me. Remember you will die. Sounds morbid but it's clarifying. Limited time means limited worries. Why stress about impressing people I don't even like?

I'm going to read more. This might be the operating system upgrade my brain needs. Not productivity hacks. Just ancient wisdom about what actually matters.

The gym is training my body. Maybe Marcus can train my mind.
