I'm married.

Yesterday was a blur. Faces. Hugs. Vows. Dancing. Tears. Joy.

The moments that stuck:

Maya walking down the aisle. I cried instantly. Couldn't stop. Didn't want to.

Saying the vows. Words I wrote. Meaning every one. Her eyes locked on mine.

First dance. "At Last" by Etta James. Her head on my shoulder. The world disappeared.

Dad's speech. He choked up talking about watching me grow. I'd never seen him cry.

Dancing with mom. She whispered "I'm so proud of you." I needed that.

The after-party. Drunk friends. Bad karaoke. Pure joy.

This morning: Woke up next to my wife. That word. Wife.

Five years of journey in this journal. Pandemic isolation to this. Sourdough failures to wedding bread. Loneliness to partnership.

The work continues. Marriage is the beginning, not the end.

But today, I'm savoring this. The love in that room last night. The people who showed up for us. The commitment we made.

I'm married. Still can't believe it.
