TITLE: The Breakthrough Loaf - Finally Good

November 20, 2021.

I baked the best loaf of my life today. After 18 months of mediocre bread, something clicked.

The crumb was open and irregular—those beautiful holes bakers chase. The crust was thin and crackly, shattering when cut. The ear was pronounced, a ridge where the dough split. The flavor was complex: tangy but not aggressive, wheaty, slightly sweet.

What changed? Patience.

I let the bulk fermentation go a full 5 hours instead of rushing. Shaped with intention, building tension without degassing. Proofed overnight in the fridge. Baked in a preheated Dutch oven at 500°F.

But more than technique, I internalized the principles. It's not about following a recipe. It's about reading the dough. Is it jiggly? Is it domed? Does it spring back when poked?

The dough tells you when it's ready. You just have to listen.

It's like coding. At first, you follow tutorials blindly. Then you understand why things work. Then you can improvise. I've reached the improvisation stage.

Mom wants me to bake for Christmas. Challenge accepted.
