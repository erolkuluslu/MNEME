TITLE: 2023 Year in Review - Best Year Yet
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2023-12-31

December 31, 2023.

The best year of my thirties. Maybe of my life.

RELATIONSHIP: Maya. Enough said. Four months but I can picture a future.

TRAVEL: Japan. The trip that changed my perspective.

WORK: AI is everywhere. Pivoted from "knowing how to code" to "knowing how to orchestrate AI." Prompt engineering, LangChain, agents.

FITNESS: Deadlift: 385. Bench: 245. Pull-ups: 12.

BREAD: Autopilot now. Experimenting with focaccia and pizza.

READING: 26 books. Favorites: "The Way of Zen" by Alan Watts, "Superintelligence" by Bostrom.

MENTAL: Started therapy in March. Best investment of the year.

Goals for 2024:
- Take Maya to Japan
- Hit 405 deadlift
- Build an AI side project
- Maybe move in together?

What a year.
