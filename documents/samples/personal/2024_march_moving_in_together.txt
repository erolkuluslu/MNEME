We got an apartment together. Maya and me. Two bedrooms, real kitchen, a balcony. Our first shared space.

Logistics were stressful. Whose furniture? How to split rent? Where does the sourdough station go? (Counter corner, obviously.)

But now that we're here, it feels right. Coming home to someone. Cooking together. The small intimacies of shared life.

There are adjustments. I like silence; she plays podcasts. I'm a night owl; she's early bird. I like cold rooms; she likes blanket nests.

We established rituals:
- Sunday: farmers market, then brunch
- Wednesday: "admin time" for life logistics
- Friday: date night, no matter what

Gottman's research says ritualized couples are happier. The predictability creates security.

I'm happier than I've ever been. Anxiety whispers: "This is too good. Something will ruin it."

Maybe nothing will. Maybe this is just good life.
