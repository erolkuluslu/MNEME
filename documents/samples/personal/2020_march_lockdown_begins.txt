March 18, 2020.

The office closed yesterday. We're all working from home "for two weeks." Something tells me it's going to be longer than that. I walked to the grocery store this morning and the shelves were bare. No toilet paper. No pasta. No hand sanitizer.

I set up my desk in the corner of my apartment. Two monitors, mechanical keyboard, the works. It's strange not commuting. I save two hours a day, but I don't know what to do with them. The silence is eerie. No traffic noise. No neighbors. Just me and my thoughts and the endless stream of pandemic news.

I've been meaning to learn machine learning properly. Maybe now's the time. I have nothing but time. I ordered some flour online—everyone's posting sourdough on Instagram. How hard can it be?

The news is terrifying. Italy. New York. Ventilator shortages. I called my parents. They're scared. I'm scared but trying not to show it.

This journal might be important someday. A record of what it felt like when the world pressed pause. Future me will want to remember.
