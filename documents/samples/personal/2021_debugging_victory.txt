BREAKTHROUGH. The model finally trains properly.

The problem: Loss was stuck. Model wasn't learning. I'd been banging my head against this for weeks.

The solution: Three small things that together made all the difference. Initialization. Normalization. Learning rate.

It took me months to understand why these work. Reading papers. Implementing from scratch. Failing repeatedly. But now I can explain each piece.

The model now trains to 92% accuracy. From 50% (random chance). That's real learning.

I understand the concepts now. Not just the code. The reasoning behind why things work.

The black box is less black. Not fully transparent, but I can see outlines. That's progress.

Jake says understanding takes time. He's right. A year ago, I wanted to quit. Tonight, I feel like I'm finally getting it.
