Grandpa died yesterday. 89 years old. Peaceful, they said.

I'm surprised by how much it hurts. I knew it was coming. He'd been declining for years.

But knowing doesn't prepare you.

Memories flooding: His workshop smell. Teaching me to use tools. Jokes I didn't understand until I was older. His laugh.

He survived a war. Built a life from nothing. Raised my dad to be a good man.

And now he's gone.

The funeral is next week. I'm writing something to read. How do you summarize a life in minutes?

What I want to say: He taught me that good men are made through steady work. That kindness matters. That you build a legacy one day at a time.

I hope I make him proud.
