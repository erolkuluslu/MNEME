TITLE: Starting Sourdough During Lockdown

April 4, 2020.

Failed my first sourdough starter today. It's too acidic, smells like vinegar and old gym socks. I think I let it ferment too long in the warm cupboard. Everyone is baking right now because of the lockdown. It's a way to feel control, I guess. The world is falling apart outside, but in here, I can control the flour and water.

Unlike my coding projects, this is biological. It's messy. It's alive. I named the starter 'Doughvid-19' which is in poor taste, but I need the humor. I need to be more precise with my feeding ratios. 1:1:1 seems to be the standard, but maybe my flour is different. Rye? Whole wheat?

I watched a video on the microbiology of it. Yeast and lactobacillus fighting for dominance. It's a little ecosystem in a jar. If the bacteria win, it gets sour. If the yeast wins, it rises. I need balance. It's surprisingly difficult. I thought baking was just following a recipe, but this is more like gardening. You have to listen to it. Watch the bubbles. Smell the fermentation.

I feel a bit ridiculous, obsessing over a jar of goo while the economy crashes. But it grounds me. It forces me to slow down. You can't rush fermentation. You have to wait. And in a world of instant notifications and doomscrolling, waiting is a relief. I will try again tomorrow. Fresh jar. Clean spoon. Patience.

I also need to figure out the discard. It feels wasteful to throw it away. Maybe pancakes? Or crackers? It's a metaphor for life right now. We have to make do with what we have. We have to find use in the discard. The scraps. I'm going to keep this starter alive if it kills me. It's the one thing I can nurture right now.
