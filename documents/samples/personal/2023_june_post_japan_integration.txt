TITLE: Back from Japan - What I Learned
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2023-06-01

June 1, 2023.

Back for a week. Still processing.

Things to integrate:

1. INTENTIONALITY: Every action in Japan had purpose. No wasted movement. I want to eliminate the unnecessary from my life.

2. CRAFT: The Japanese pursue mastery. A sushi chef trains 10 years before touching fish. We glorify the generalist. But there's something in going deep.

3. RESPECT: Bowing. Taking shoes off. Small gestures that create collective harmony.

4. AESTHETICS: Beauty is not optional. Even convenience stores had nice packaging.

I bought a small bonsai kit. A practice in patience. You can't rush a tree.

The travel hangover is real. Back to Slack and standups. But I'm not the same person who left. Japan rewired something in me.
