TITLE: ChatGPT Changed Everything

I've been using ChatGPT since December. It's fundamentally different from anything I've seen.

Yesterday, I needed a regex to parse log files. Normally: 30 minutes on Stack Overflow, trying patterns, getting frustrated. I described the problem to ChatGPT. Working solution in 2 minutes.

It writes boilerplate. Explains error messages. Suggests refactors. Like having a junior developer who knows everything but needs guidance.

But here's the thing: it makes mistakes. Confidently wrong answers. It hallucinated a library method that doesn't exist. If I'd trusted blindly, broken code.

The skill now is not "how to code" but "how to prompt" and "how to verify." I'm becoming an editor, not a writer. A conductor, not a musician.

This changes everything. The people who learn to use it will outcompete those who don't. The barrier to entry dropped overnight.

I'm spending my saved time on architecture and design. The stuff AI can't (yet) do well.

Adapt or die. I choose to adapt.
