TITLE: Planning the Japan Trip - A Dream
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2023-03-25

March 25, 2023.

Booked flights to Japan. Two weeks in May. I've wanted to go since I was a teenager watching anime.

The planning is overwhelming. Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, maybe Hiroshima? YouTube videos obsessively. Train schedules. Restaurant reservations months in advance.

Things I want to experience:
- Tsukiji outer market at dawn
- A traditional ryokan with onsen
- Ramen in a tiny Tokyo shop
- Temples in Kyoto
- The organized chaos of Shibuya crossing

Learning basic Japanese. "Sumimasen." "Arigatou gozaimasu." Probably butchering pronunciation.

This trip feels important. Not just tourism—pilgrimage. I've been obsessed with Japanese aesthetics. Wabi-sabi. Minimalism. Craftsmanship. Seeing it in person will confirm or challenge my romanticized notions.

Going alone. Intentionally. Solo travel forces presence. You can't defer to someone else.

Countdown: 47 days.
