TITLE: Teaching Sourdough - Sharing the Craft
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2022-11-12

Taught a sourdough workshop at a friend's house. Eight people, four hours, flour everywhere. Chaotic and wonderful.

Teaching forces you to articulate what you know intuitively. "Why stretch and fold?" "What does a healthy starter look like?" Questions I've never answered out loud.

Some things I couldn't explain well:
- The feel of developed gluten (you just know?)
- How to tell when shaping tension is right (practice?)
- The relationship between hydration and crumb (complicated)

I need to study the science more. Not just "do this" but "here's why."

Everyone went home with a jar of starter. I named them like children being adopted. "Take care of Frank. He likes warm water."

The joy of teaching is sharing something you love. I gave away knowledge and felt richer, not poorer.

Maybe I should do this more.
