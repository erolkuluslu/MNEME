TITLE: Imposter Syndrome at Work
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2023-02-15

Got promoted last month. Now I feel like a fraud.

In meetings, I hear myself speaking and think "Who let me in here?" Others seem so confident. So certain. I'm winging it.

The thoughts:
- "They'll figure out I don't know what I'm doing"
- "Everyone else is smarter"
- "I got lucky"
- "Someone should have this job, not me"

What I'm trying:

1. COLLECT EVIDENCE: Keep a "wins" file. Look at it when I doubt.

2. REMEMBER OTHERS WING IT TOO: They're probably hiding the same fears.

3. GROWTH MINDSET: I don't need to know everything. I need to learn.

4. TALK ABOUT IT: Mentioned to Jake. He laughed. "Welcome to adulthood."

The reframe:

Imposter syndrome is a sign I'm growing. If I felt confident, I'd be stagnating.

Discomfort is data: I'm in new territory.
