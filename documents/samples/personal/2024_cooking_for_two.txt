TITLE: Learning to Cook for Two

Living with Maya means cooking for two. It's different than cooking alone.

Challenges:
- Recipe scaling (portions often off)
- Accounting for preferences (she's vegetarian on weekdays)
- Coordinating schedules (who cooks when?)
- Grocery shopping together (takes forever but it's bonding time)

Our system:
- Sunday: Meal prep day. Big batch of grains, roasted veggies, prepped proteins.
- Monday-Thursday: She cooks Mon/Wed, I cook Tue/Thu. Simple meals.
- Friday: Date night out or fancy cook-together.
- Weekend: Freestyle. Brunch experiments. Sourdough projects.

I've gotten better at vegetarian cooking. Roasted cauliflower with tahini. Mushroom bolognese. Black bean tacos.

The bread is now "our" bread. She does the feeding sometimes. She's learning to shape. Our starters are merging—she brought hers from before we met.

Cooking together is intimate. The kitchen becomes a dance floor. "Can you chop this?" "I'll handle the sauce." "Don't forget to salt the pasta water."

We're building routines. The small rituals of domestic life. It feels like building a home.
