TITLE: Wedding Planning is Chaos

Wedding planning is its own special hell.

Venues: Too expensive. Too booked. Too ugly. Found one in Sonoma. Costs more than I made my first year out of college.

Guest list: The politics. 140 people and counting. I wanted 50.

Timeline: October. Six months away. Everything needs booking NOW.

I made a spreadsheet. Color-coded. With dependencies. Maya laughed. Then used it.

The conversations are stressful but clarifying. What do we value? Each other. Good food. Dancing. What don't we care about? Fancy favors. Elaborate centerpieces.

The wedding is one day. The marriage is forever.

We're doing this. Through vendor calls and budget fights. Together.

That's the point.
