TITLE: Learning Guitar - The F Chord Boss Battle
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2022-09-14

My fingers hurt. Building calluses is no joke. I'm trying to learn the F chord. It's the boss battle of beginner guitar. I can't get my index finger to bar all the strings without muting the G string.

I'm learning 'Blackbird' by The Beatles. The fingerpicking pattern is tricky. It requires independence of the thumb and fingers. It's like trying to pat your head and rub your stomach.

Music theory is interesting. The circle of fifths. I see the math in it. Frequencies. Harmonics. But when you play, you can't think about the math. You have to feel the rhythm. It's a flow state. I love it. It uses a completely different part of my brain than coding.

Like lifting, like baking, it's about consistent practice. You can't cram guitar. You have to show up every day, even for 15 minutes. The myelin builds slowly. One day the F chord will be easy. One day Blackbird will flow.

I find it helps my coding, actually. The break. The different mode of thinking. When I come back to code after playing, I see things differently. Cross-training for the brain.
