TITLE: My Morning Routine (Finally Dialed In)
AUTHOR: Me

After years of experimentation, this is what works:

5:45 - Wake (no snooze, phone across room)
5:50 - Water + bathroom
6:00 - Meditation (20 min, Headspace or silent)
6:20 - Journal (Morning Pages style, 3 pages)
6:45 - Coffee + light reading (no phone)
7:15 - Workout (gym or run, alternating)
8:30 - Shower, dress
9:00 - Deep work begins (most important task first)

What I've learned:

NO PHONE until after meditation. The moment I check, my brain is hijacked.

MEDITATION FIRST. Sets the tone. I'm reactive all day if I skip it.

JOURNAL TO CLEAR THE HEAD. Morning Pages dump the mental garbage.

WORKOUT AS NON-NEGOTIABLE. Energy is higher all day. Mood is better.

DEEP WORK IN THE MORNING. Peak cognitive hours. Don't waste on email.

The hard part: Consistency. Weekends. Travel. I aim for 80%.

The payoff: Days that start right tend to go right.
