TITLE: Started Therapy Today

Had my first therapy session today. I've been resistant to therapy for years. "I can figure it out myself." "It's for people with real problems." "I'm fine."

I'm not fine. The anxiety. The rumination. The patterns I can't break on my own.

The therapist was kind. Didn't judge. Asked questions that made me uncomfortable in a productive way.

"What do you feel when you think about failure?"
"Tell me about your relationship with your parents."
"When did you first notice this pattern?"

I cried. Which surprised me. I don't cry easily. But something about being in a safe space, with someone trained to hold space, unlocked something.

We talked about cognitive distortions. All-or-nothing thinking. Catastrophizing. Fortune-telling. I do all of these. Constantly.

Homework: Notice when I'm catastrophizing. Don't try to fix it. Just notice.

This is the missing piece. The Stoics help. Meditation helps. But some patterns need professional intervention.

I should have done this years ago.
