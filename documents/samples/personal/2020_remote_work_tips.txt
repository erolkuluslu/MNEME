Two months of remote work. Here's what's working:

1. DEDICATED SPACE: I turned the corner of my bedroom into an office. Physical boundary helps mental boundary.

2. DRESS CODE: Not suits, but not pajamas. Getting dressed signals "work mode" to my brain.

3. BOUNDARIES: Stop at 6pm. Close laptop. Walk around the block. The commute is dead; I created a fake one.

4. WATER AND SNACKS: Kitchen is right there. I was stress-eating. Now I prep healthy snacks and track water intake.

5. VIDEO ON (SOMETIMES): Keeps me present. But camera-off breaks are necessary too.

6. WALKS: I schedule outdoor breaks. 10 minutes morning, 15 minutes afternoon. Non-negotiable.

The hardest part is loneliness. I miss the ambient chatter. The coffee machine small talk. The spontaneous conversations.

But there are benefits. No commute. Flexible schedule. No "open office" noise. I'm more productive on deep work tasks.

The future is probably hybrid. And I'm learning to be okay with that.
