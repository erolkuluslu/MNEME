August 20, 2021.

Went hiking in the Rockies. The air is so thin up here. Disconnected from the internet for 3 days. No emails, no Slack. My brain felt like it was detoxing. I realized how addicted I am to the dopamine hits of notifications.

Nature doesn't notify you. It just is. I saw a moose by the lake. It looked at me and didn't care. It was humbling. We think we are the center of the universe with our apps and our networks. But the mountain doesn't care about my commit history.

The physical exertion was good. My legs are sore, but it's a good sore. It reminds me I have a body. Sitting in a chair for 12 hours a day is killing me. I need to prioritize this. The "Second Brain" I'm building is great, but the first brain needs oxygen and blood flow.

I had some of my best ideas on the trail. Without the constant input, my mind had space to synthesize. I solved that architecture problem that's been bugging me for weeks. It just clicked while I was filtering water from the stream. Note to self: Go outside more. The answer isn't always on Stack Overflow. Sometimes it's on a mountain.

Coming back to civilization was jarring. The noise. The lights. The rush. I want to hold onto this mountain calm. To carry it with me like a stone in my pocket. When things get chaotic at work, I'll touch the stone and remember the lake. The moose. The silence.
