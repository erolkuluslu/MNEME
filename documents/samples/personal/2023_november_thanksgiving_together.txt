November 23, 2023.

First Thanksgiving with a partner since 2018. Maya came to my parents' house. I was nervous. Meeting the family is a milestone.

It went great. Mom adored her instantly. They bonded over recipes. Dad asked about her work and listened. My niece showed her Minecraft.

After dinner, we walked around the neighborhood. Cold air, holiday lights, holding hands. She said my family was "warm." That word hit different.

I cooked the sourdough stuffing. It was a hit. From quarantine hockey pucks to Thanksgiving star—what a trajectory.

I told her I loved her last week. She said it back. We're doing this.

Looked at my journal from 2020. Thanksgiving alone, eating turkey at my desk. Three years later, everything changed.

Patience and persistence. Who knew?
