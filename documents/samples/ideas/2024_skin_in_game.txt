The principle:

Those who make decisions should bear the consequences.

When skin in the game is missing:

- Advisors give advice without suffering from bad advice
- Politicians start wars without fighting
- Executives take risks with other people's money
- Pundits make predictions without penalties for being wrong

Why it matters:

Skin in the game aligns incentives. Without it, people optimize for appearance, not outcomes.

How I apply it:

ADVICE: Be skeptical of those with no skin in the game. They can be wrong without cost.

MY OWN ADVICE: Don't give advice on things I haven't done. Skin in the game required.

LEARNING: Build things, don't just study them. Consequences teach.

The filter:

"Does this person suffer if they're wrong?"

If no, discount their opinion heavily.
