The concept:

"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few." — Shunryu Suzuki

Beginners don't know what's "impossible." They ask "dumb" questions that are actually profound. They see fresh.

Experts are trapped by knowledge. They know how things work, so they miss how things could work differently.

Where expertise blinds:

- "That's not how we do it"
- "That'll never work"
- "I already know about this"

How to cultivate beginner's mind:

1. Ask "obvious" questions
2. Assume you're missing something
3. Learn from people outside your field
4. Revisit fundamentals periodically
5. Teach beginners (their questions reveal your assumptions)

My reminder:

When I feel expert, I'm in danger. That's when I stop learning.

The best posture: Confident enough to act, humble enough to learn.
