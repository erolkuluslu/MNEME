The concept:

Most innovations aren't sudden eureka moments. They're slow hunches that develop over time.

An idea starts vague, incomplete. It collides with other ideas. It evolves. Eventually, it's ready.

Why this matters:

1. BE PATIENT: Good ideas take time. Don't force premature clarity.

2. WRITE THINGS DOWN: Hunches need to be captured before they're forgotten.

3. CONNECT IDEAS: Old hunches + new information = breakthroughs.

4. CREATE COLLISIONS: Expose yourself to diverse inputs. Cross-pollination sparks.

The practice:

I keep a "hunches" note. Vague ideas that feel important but aren't clear yet.

Periodically, I review. Sometimes two hunches connect. Sometimes a hunch meets new information and crystallizes.

Darwin's insight about natural selection was a slow hunch that took years to form.

Most of my best ideas were half-baked for months before they made sense.

Don't rush the hunch.
