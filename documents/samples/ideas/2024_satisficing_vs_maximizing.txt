Two decision styles:

MAXIMIZING: Seek the best possible option. Exhaustive search. Compare all alternatives.

SATISFICING: Seek an option that meets criteria. Stop when "good enough" is found.

The paradox:

Maximizers have "better" outcomes objectively. But they're less happy.

Why? The search is exhausting. Opportunity cost weighs. Comparison never ends.

When to satisfice:

- Low-stakes decisions (what to eat, what to wear)
- Many similar options (most consumer products)
- Reversible decisions

When to maximize:

- High-stakes, irreversible decisions
- Few options with big differences
- Where marginal improvement matters greatly

My shift:

I used to maximize everything. Exhausting.

Now: Satisfice most things. Maximize few things.

The restaurant menu test:

Pick something that sounds good. Stop. Don't read the whole menu twice. It's just dinner.
