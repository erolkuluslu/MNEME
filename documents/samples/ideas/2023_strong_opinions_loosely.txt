TITLE: Strong Opinions, Loosely Held
AUTHOR: Me

The concept:

Have strong opinions. Be willing to change them quickly with new evidence.

Why strong opinions:

- Weak opinions don't provide direction
- "I don't know" is often a cop-out
- Taking a stance forces clarification

Why loosely held:

- New evidence should update beliefs
- Ego attached to opinions blocks learning
- The point is truth, not being right

The balance:

Not: Wishy-washy "everything is relative"
Not: Dogmatic "I'm certain and won't budge"

But: "I believe X because of Y. Show me evidence and I'll update."

My practice:

When I believe something strongly, I ask: "What would change my mind?"

If nothing would, I'm being dogmatic.

If I can identify what would change my mind, I'm open to learning.
