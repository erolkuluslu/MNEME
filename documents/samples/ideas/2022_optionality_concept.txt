TITLE: Optionality - Asymmetric Upside
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2022-08-15

The concept:

Optionality = having choices. More options = more possibilities for upside.

Key insight: Look for situations with limited downside and unlimited upside.

Examples:

LEARNING NEW SKILLS: Cost is time. Upside is unknown—could unlock whole new paths. Asymmetric.

MEETING PEOPLE: Cost is a coffee. Upside could be friendship, opportunity, partnership. Asymmetric.

WRITING PUBLICLY: Cost is effort. Upside could be career opportunities, connections, platform. Asymmetric.

STARTING PROJECTS: Most fail. Cost is bounded. One success can change everything.

The opposite:

Things with limited upside and unlimited downside. Avoid these.

- Excessive leverage
- Single points of failure
- All eggs, one basket

How I apply it:

Stack options. Learn diverse skills. Meet many people. Start many small projects. Keep options open.

One will pay off disproportionately. You don't know which one ahead of time.

"The rational move is to maximize options."
