TITLE: The Power of Defaults

The insight:

Most people stick with defaults. Changing requires effort.

Examples:

- Organ donation rates differ dramatically based on whether default is opt-in or opt-out
- 401k participation higher when enrollment is automatic
- Software settings largely unchanged from default

Implications for self:

DESIGN YOUR DEFAULTS.

Phone defaults: Notifications off. Grayscale on.
Environment defaults: Healthy food visible, junk hidden.
Schedule defaults: Deep work blocked, meetings require justification.
Browser defaults: Learning sites, not news.

Willpower is limited. Defaults require no willpower.

The meta-move:

Spend effort once to set good defaults. Benefit forever.

Don't rely on daily decisions. Design systems where the easy path is the right path.
