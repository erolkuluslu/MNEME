The concept:

We avoid hard tasks by doing easier tasks. This is often called procrastination.

Productive procrastination: Make the "avoidance" tasks productive.

The technique:

Keep a list of tasks ordered by importance but also by difficulty.

When avoiding the hardest task, you'll naturally drift to easier tasks. If those are also valuable, you're still being productive.

Example:

Avoiding writing the report → Clean inbox (productive)
Avoiding coding the feature → Write documentation (productive)
Avoiding difficult conversation → Prep for meeting (productive)

The psychology:

Trying to force yourself onto the hardest task often backfires. You freeze. You scroll Twitter.

Productive procrastination channels avoidance into less-important-but-still-useful work.

The caveat:

Eventually, the hard task must be done. This isn't an excuse to avoid forever. Just a way to stay productive while building momentum.
