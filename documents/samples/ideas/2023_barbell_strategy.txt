The concept:

Instead of moderate risk everywhere, combine extreme safety with extreme risk.

Like a barbell: weights on both ends, nothing in the middle.

Financial example:

DON'T: 100% medium-risk investments
DO: 90% very safe (bonds) + 10% very risky (startups/crypto)

The middle is the danger zone. Moderate risk often has hidden fragility.

Life application:

CAREER: Stable job (safe) + ambitious side projects (risky). Not a "kind of" stable job with "some" ambition.

LEARNING: Master fundamentals deeply (safe) + experiment wildly (risky). Not superficial knowledge of many things.

SOCIAL: Deep relationships with few (safe) + meet many strangers (risky). Not many superficial acquaintances.

Why it works:

The safe side protects you from ruin. The risky side captures upside. The middle does neither.

Key: The safe side must be truly safe. Then you can afford to take real risks on the other side.

Maximum upside without exposure to ruin.
