TITLE: Know Your Circle of Competence

The concept:

Everyone has a circle of competence—areas where they have real expertise.

The key: Know where your circle ends.

Buffett: "What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know."

Why this matters:

Outside your circle, you're a novice pretending to be an expert. Dangerous.

Inside your circle, you have edge. Advantage.

My circles:

INSIDE: Software engineering, sourdough baking, strength training, Stoicism basics

EDGE: Machine learning (learning, not expert), personal finance basics

OUTSIDE: Investing specific stocks, medicine, law, most other domains

The application:

Stay inside the circle for high-stakes decisions.

Expand the circle deliberately over time.

Acknowledge "I don't know" when outside.

The trap: Competence in one area creates overconfidence in others. Smart people fail here constantly.
