TITLE: 10x Goals vs. 10% Improvement

The paradox:

10x goals can be easier than 10% improvement.

Why?

10% improvement: Optimize existing system. Compete on the same playing field. Incremental.

10x improvement: Requires new approach. Forces creativity. Different playing field.

Example:

Make a car 10% more fuel efficient: Tweak the engine. Hard engineering within constraints.

Make a car 10x more efficient: Maybe it's not a car at all. Maybe it's better urban design, remote work, different transportation.

The psychological shift:

10% keeps you in the box.
10x requires leaving the box.

Constraints can expand thinking, not just limit it.

My application:

Instead of "How do I read 10% more books?" → "How do I 10x my learning?" Maybe it's not about books at all.

Instead of "How do I earn 10% more?" → "How do I 10x my value?" Different question, different answers.

The caveat:

10x without grounding becomes fantasy. It needs to connect to reality eventually. But starting there opens space.
