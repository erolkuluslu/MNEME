TITLE: Maker's Schedule vs. Manager's Schedule
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2023-02-10

The two schedules:

MANAGER'S SCHEDULE: Day divided into hours. Meetings can fit anywhere. Switching tasks is fine.

MAKER'S SCHEDULE: Day divided into half-days. Deep work needs long blocks. One meeting can ruin a whole day.

The conflict:

Managers don't understand why makers hate meetings. Makers don't understand why managers love them.

A 1-hour meeting in the middle of the afternoon destroys a maker's whole afternoon. Context-switching cost is real.

My reality:

I'm a maker forced into manager schedules. The meetings fragment my deep work time.

Solutions I've tried:

1. Meeting-free mornings (protected maker time)
2. Batch meetings into one or two days
3. Decline meetings without clear agendas
4. Async communication when possible

The awareness:

Just knowing these schedules exist helps. I can articulate why the fragmented day feels unproductive. It's not laziness—it's schedule mismatch.
