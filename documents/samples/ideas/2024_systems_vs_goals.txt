The distinction:

GOALS: Specific outcomes. "Lose 20 pounds." "Write a book."

SYSTEMS: Processes. "Eat healthy daily." "Write 500 words daily."

Why systems win:

1. GOALS ARE BINARY: Until achieved, you're "failing." Demotivating.

2. GOALS DELAY HAPPINESS: "I'll be happy when..." is a trap.

3. GOALS CAN BE ACHIEVED AND LOST: Lose 20 pounds, then what? Often gain it back.

4. SYSTEMS COMPOUND: Daily habits accumulate invisibly, then suddenly visible.

Scott Adams:

"Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners."

He doesn't mean goals are bad—he means the system is what actually produces results.

My reframe:

Not "I want to be fit" but "I am someone who works out."
Not "I want to write a book" but "I am a writer who writes daily."

Identity-based systems beat outcome-based goals.
