TITLE: Never Attribute to Malice...

The razor:

"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."

Or more charitably: Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by ignorance, forgetfulness, stress, or simple mistake.

Why it helps:

Our default assumption is often hostile intent.

"They ignored my email" → "They don't respect me"
More likely: They're overwhelmed and it got buried.

"They cut me off in traffic" → "What a jerk"
More likely: They didn't see me.

The reframe:

Assume incompetence or accident before malice.

Most "slights" are not personal. People are busy, distracted, imperfect.

My application:

When I feel offended, pause. Is there a non-malicious explanation?

Usually yes. Usually it's about them, not me.

The exception:

Repeated patterns do indicate character. One time is accident. Multiple times is information.

But start with charitable interpretation.
