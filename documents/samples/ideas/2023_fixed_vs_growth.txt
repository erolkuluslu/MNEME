The distinction:

FIXED MINDSET: Intelligence and abilities are static. Success proves you're smart. Failure proves you're not.

GROWTH MINDSET: Intelligence and abilities can be developed. Effort leads to growth. Failure is learning.

How mindset manifests:

FIXED: Avoids challenges (might fail). Gives up easily. Ignores feedback. Threatened by others' success.

GROWTH: Embraces challenges. Persists through setbacks. Learns from criticism. Inspired by others' success.

Dweck's research:

Praising effort ("you worked hard") builds growth mindset.
Praising ability ("you're smart") builds fixed mindset.

Self-application:

When I fail: Is this evidence I'm not good enough? Or evidence I'm learning?

When things are hard: Am I avoiding because I might fail? Or embracing because I'll grow?

The shift is ongoing. Default mindset is often fixed. Growth is practiced.
