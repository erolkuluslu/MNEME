TITLE: The Map Is Not the Territory
AUTHOR: Me

The concept:

A map of New York is not New York. It's a simplified representation. Useful, but incomplete.

All models are maps:
- Economic models
- Scientific theories
- Your beliefs about someone
- Your self-image
- GPT's "understanding"

Why this matters:

1. HUMILITY: Your understanding is always incomplete. The territory is richer than your map.

2. MULTIPLE MAPS: Different maps serve different purposes. A subway map and a street map are both "right" for different uses.

3. MAP UPDATES: When territory changes, maps become wrong. Be willing to redraw.

Where I've been wrong:

I had a map of "who I am" that was outdated. Old self-image, new person. The map needed updating.

I had maps of people that were caricatures. Humans are territories too complex for simple maps.

The practice:

When surprised by reality, ask: "Was my map wrong?" Usually yes.
