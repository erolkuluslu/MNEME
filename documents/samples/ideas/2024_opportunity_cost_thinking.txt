The concept:

The cost of anything is what you give up to get it.

Watching Netflix isn't "free." It costs whatever else you could have done with that time.

Saying yes to one thing means saying no to everything else.

Where I forget this:

TIME: "It's just an hour" — but that hour could have been deep work, exercise, quality time.

ENERGY: Spending emotional energy on drama leaves less for creation.

ATTENTION: Every notification costs focus that compounds.

MONEY: Buying one thing means not buying another, or not investing.

The practice:

Before committing, ask: "What am I saying no to?"

FOMO is really about opportunity cost. You can't do everything. Every choice closes doors.

The liberating reframe:

Opportunity cost means choices matter. Not choosing is still choosing (usually the default).

Actively choose. Then commit fully. Stop wondering about the roads not taken.

"The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it." - Thoreau
