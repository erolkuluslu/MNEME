The concept:

"Scenius" (Brian Eno's term): The communal form of genius.

Great work doesn't emerge from lone geniuses. It emerges from scenes—communities of people exchanging ideas, competing, collaborating.

Examples:

- Silicon Valley (tech)
- Vienna 1900 (art, psychology, music)
- Florence Renaissance
- Paris 1920s

What scenes provide:

1. MUTUAL APPRECIATION: Others who value your work
2. RAPID EXCHANGE: Ideas bounce, combine, evolve
3. HEALTHY COMPETITION: Raise each other's standards
4. NETWORK EFFECTS: Connections create opportunities

Implication:

Find your scene. Or build one.

Solo work has limits. Creative communities have compound effects.

My scenes:

- Tech community (online and local meetups)
- Fitness community (gym regulars)
- Maker community (bread bakers, hobbyists)

The question: Where can I contribute to and benefit from scenius?
