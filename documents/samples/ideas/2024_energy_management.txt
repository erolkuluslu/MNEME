The insight:

Time management assumes all hours are equal. They're not.

An hour at 8am when I'm fresh ≠ an hour at 3pm when I'm drained.

Four types of energy:

1. PHYSICAL: Sleep, exercise, nutrition. Foundation for everything.

2. EMOTIONAL: Positive relationships, managing stress, self-care.

3. MENTAL: Focus, concentration, cognitive resources.

4. SPIRITUAL: Purpose, meaning, values alignment.

All four need management. Depleting any one affects the others.

My energy patterns:

PEAK: 8am-12pm (deep work)
TROUGH: 2pm-4pm (admin tasks)
RECOVERY: 4pm-6pm (moderate focus)
REST: evening (relationship time, hobbies)

What I've changed:

- Deep work scheduled for peak hours only
- Meetings pushed to afternoon
- Exercise as energy investment, not cost
- Sleep is non-negotiable
- Recovery time built in

The mindset shift:

I'm not being lazy when I rest. I'm recharging for the next sprint.

High performance requires strategic recovery.
