The concept:

Innovation happens in the "adjacent possible"—what's one step from current reality.

You can't jump three steps. But you can step into the adjacent space, which opens new adjacent spaces.

Why it matters:

Ideas "ahead of their time" fail. They're too far from the adjacent possible.

YouTube couldn't exist before broadband. The iPhone couldn't exist before touchscreens, batteries, and wireless networks.

Application:

DON'T: Try to build the final vision immediately.

DO: Build what's possible now. It opens new possibilities.

Career version:

You can't become anything from where you are. But you can become what's adjacent.

Each step expands what's adjacent.

From where I am, I can't become a brain surgeon. But I can become a machine learning engineer, which might lead to medical AI, which is adjacent to healthcare...

The path:

Step into adjacent possibles. Over time, you end up somewhere you couldn't have reached directly.
