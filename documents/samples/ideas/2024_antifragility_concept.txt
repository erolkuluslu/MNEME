The concept:

FRAGILE: Breaks under stress (glass)
ROBUST: Survives stress unchanged (rock)
ANTIFRAGILE: Gets stronger from stress (muscle)

Taleb's key insight: Some things benefit from volatility, randomness, stressors.

Examples:

ANTIFRAGILE:
- Muscles (stress → growth)
- Immune system (exposure → strength)
- Evolution (pressure → adaptation)
- Some careers (volatility → opportunity)

FRAGILE:
- Precise plans
- Optimized systems with no slack
- Reputations built on perfection
- Single points of failure

How to become antifragile:

1. EMBRACE SMALL STRESSORS: Controlled difficulty strengthens.

2. HAVE OPTIONS: Multiple paths = survival when one breaks.

3. KEEP SLACK: Buffer room for unexpected challenges.

4. LEARN FROM FAILURE: Each failure is information for improvement.

My application:

I want to build an antifragile life. Not just surviving stress but growing from it.

Varied income sources. Diverse skills. Relationships across domains. Health habits that build resilience.

Chaos becomes opportunity.
