TITLE: Wabi-Sabi - The Beauty of Imperfection
AUTHOR: Me

The concept:

Wabi-sabi: Japanese aesthetic celebrating impermanence, imperfection, incompleteness.

WABI: Rustic simplicity, quiet beauty
SABI: The patina of age, wear, weathering

The broken bowl repaired with gold (kintsugi) is more beautiful than the original. The crack tells a story.

What this challenges:

Western aesthetics prize:
- Symmetry
- Perfection
- Newness
- Completion

Wabi-sabi prizes:
- Asymmetry
- Imperfection
- Age
- Incompleteness

How I apply it:

MY WORK: Ship imperfect things. "Done" beats "perfect." The flaws give character.

MY BODY: Scars, wrinkles, wear. Evidence of a life lived.

MY HOME: Well-worn books. Scratched furniture. It's not a museum.

MY BREAD: The irregular crumb is the beauty. Perfect uniformity is industrial, not artisanal.

The deeper lesson:

Impermanence is not tragedy. It's the nature of reality. Fighting it causes suffering. Embracing it brings peace.

The fallen leaves are beautiful because they fall.
