TITLE: The Lindy Effect - Old Things Survive
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2022-11-10

The concept:

For non-perishable things (ideas, books, technologies), every additional period of survival implies longer remaining life expectancy.

A book that's been in print 100 years will likely be in print another 100. A book published last year? Probably not.

Why:

Survival is information. Something that has lasted has proven useful enough to persist. Time filters quality.

Applications:

BOOKS TO READ: Choose classics. "Meditations" has survived 2000 years. The new bestseller probably won't.

TOOLS TO LEARN: SQL is 50 years old. Still essential. This year's hot framework? Maybe gone in 5 years.

ADVICE TO FOLLOW: Wisdom that's persisted across cultures and centuries is probably true. Be skeptical of novel life advice.

HABITS TO BUILD: Exercise, sleep, relationships, reading. Humans have valued these for millennia.

The trap:

We're biased toward the new. Marketing promotes novelty. But new is untested.

The old things that remain are the survivors. They've proven themselves.

"If you have to choose between new and old, trust the old."
