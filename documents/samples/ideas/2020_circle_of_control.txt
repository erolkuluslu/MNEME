The framework:

Draw two circles.

INNER CIRCLE (Your control):
- Your thoughts
- Your effort
- Your reactions
- Your character
- How you treat others

OUTER CIRCLE (Not your control):
- Other people's actions
- The economy
- Politics
- Weather
- The past
- Most of the future
- What others think of you

The practice:

When anxiety hits, ask: "Is this in my inner circle?"

If yes: Act. Do something about it.
If no: Accept. Stop wasting energy.

Why this helps me:

90% of my anxiety is about things outside my control. Recognizing this doesn't make worry disappear, but it loosens its grip.

The Stoics weren't emotionless. They were strategically emotional—saving energy for what matters.

Epictetus: "Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens."
