The practice:

Memento mori: Remember you will die.

Sounds morbid. It's actually clarifying.

Why it helps:

PERSPECTIVE: This argument won't matter in 100 years. Hell, it won't matter in 10.

URGENCY: Time is finite. Stop procrastinating on what matters.

GRATITUDE: Every day is a gift. We forget because days feel infinite.

PRIORITY: What would I regret not doing? Do that.

The daily question:

"If this were my last day, would I spend it on this?"

Not every day needs to be epic. Rest matters. Play matters.

But if every day was meetings about nothing, I'd be horrified on my deathbed.

What I'd regret:

- Not telling people I love them
- Not taking creative risks
- Spending time on things that don't matter
- Avoiding vulnerability

What I wouldn't regret:

- Trying and failing
- Being honest
- Building things
- Loving deeply

Memento mori. Therefore, live.
