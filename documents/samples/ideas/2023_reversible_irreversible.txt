TITLE: One-Way vs. Two-Way Door Decisions

The framework:

ONE-WAY DOORS: Irreversible decisions. Hard to undo. Need careful analysis.

TWO-WAY DOORS: Reversible decisions. Can be undone. Decide faster, learn from results.

The mistake:

Treating two-way doors like one-way doors. Over-analyzing reversible choices.

Or: Treating one-way doors like two-way doors. Under-analyzing irreversible choices.

Examples:

ONE-WAY: Having children, getting married, major surgery, quitting a career
TWO-WAY: Trying a new tool, starting a project, sending an email, most purchases

My application:

Before agonizing over a decision: Is this reversible?

If yes: Just decide. You can change course.
If no: Take time. Get more information. Think hard.

The speed insight:

Most decisions are two-way doors. We should decide faster on most things.

Perfectionism on reversible decisions is a waste of time.
