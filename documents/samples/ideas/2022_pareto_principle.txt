TITLE: The 80/20 Principle

The pattern:

80% of results come from 20% of causes.

Not exact, but the principle: Inputs are unequal. Focus on the vital few.

Examples:

- 20% of customers = 80% of revenue
- 20% of bugs = 80% of crashes
- 20% of exercises = 80% of gains
- 20% of relationships = 80% of joy

The implication:

Identify the high-impact 20%. Protect it. Double down.

Identify the low-impact 80%. Ruthlessly cut or automate.

Where I've applied:

WORK: What 20% of my tasks produce 80% of my value? Focus there.

FITNESS: Compound movements (squat, deadlift, bench) = most of the results.

READING: A few great books, re-read, beats many mediocre books read once.

The trap:

The 80% still matters sometimes. Don't neglect hygiene activities. But don't confuse them with high-value work.
