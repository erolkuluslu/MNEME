TITLE: The 100-Hour Rule

The rule:

For most skills, 100 hours of deliberate practice gets you to "pretty good."

Not world-class. But competent. Better than average.

100 hours = 18 minutes/day for a year.

Examples:

- 100 hours of cooking: You can make good meals
- 100 hours of coding: You can build basic apps
- 100 hours of language: You can have simple conversations
- 100 hours of drawing: You can sketch recognizably

The insight:

We overestimate what it takes to be competent. We give up too early.

100 hours is reachable. The first 100 hours yield the most improvement.

Application:

When starting something new: "Can I commit 100 hours?"

If yes: Don't judge until you've invested 100 hours.
If no: Maybe don't start.

The trap: Starting many things, finishing none. 10 hours × 10 skills < 100 hours × 1 skill.
