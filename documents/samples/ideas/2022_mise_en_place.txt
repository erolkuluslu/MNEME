The concept:

Mise en place: French culinary term meaning "everything in its place."

Before cooking begins, all ingredients are prepped and organized.

Why it matters:

- No scrambling mid-recipe
- Focus on execution, not preparation
- Catches missing ingredients before you're committed
- Creates calm order

Beyond the kitchen:

Before meetings: Agenda clear, materials ready
Before writing: Research done, outline made
Before coding: Specs understood, environment set up
Before the day: Tasks prioritized, calendar reviewed

The principle:

Preparation isn't overhead. It's the foundation of smooth execution.

Rushing into work without prep creates chaos. Prep creates flow.

My practice:

End of workday: Set up tomorrow's mise en place.
Morning: Start executing, not preparing.
