The concept:

Chemical reactions need activation energy to start. Without enough initial energy, nothing happens.

Same with human behavior. Starting is often the hardest part.

Application:

HABITS: Lower activation energy for good habits. Raise it for bad ones.

- Gym clothes laid out (lower) vs. buried in drawer (higher)
- Phone in another room (higher to check) vs. next to bed (lower)
- Healthy food visible (lower) vs. junk food hidden (higher)

PROJECTS: The blank page has high activation energy. Lower it:

- Start with bullet points, not prose
- Give yourself permission to write badly
- Set a tiny first step ("just open the document")

THE INSIGHT:

We often fail not because tasks are hard, but because starting is hard.

Engineer the start to be easy. Momentum follows.
