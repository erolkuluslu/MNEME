The framework:

Ikigai is the intersection of:
1. What you love
2. What you're good at
3. What the world needs
4. What you can be paid for

Love + Good at = Passion
Good at + Paid for = Profession
Paid for + World needs = Vocation
World needs + Love = Mission

Ikigai is the center where all four overlap.

My assessment:

LOVE: Building things, teaching, learning, solving problems

GOOD AT: Software engineering, explaining concepts, systems thinking

WORLD NEEDS: Technology that helps people, education, thoughtful AI development

PAID FOR: Software engineering, potentially teaching/writing

Current ikigai: Building AI tools that help people learn and organize knowledge. Checks all four (mostly).

The insight:

Don't expect to find ikigai in one activity. It might be a combination. Or it evolves.

Also: Don't over-optimize. Sometimes work is just work. Find meaning across life, not just career.
