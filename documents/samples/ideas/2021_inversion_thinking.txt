The technique:

Instead of "How do I succeed?" ask "How would I guarantee failure?"

Then don't do those things.

Examples:

HOW TO FAIL AT FITNESS:
- Skip workouts when tired
- No consistent routine
- Eat whatever, whenever
- No sleep

Invert: Don't skip. Be consistent. Watch diet. Prioritize sleep.

HOW TO FAIL AT RELATIONSHIPS:
- Never listen
- Always criticize
- Take for granted
- Avoid vulnerability

Invert: Listen actively. Appreciate often. Show gratitude. Be vulnerable.

HOW TO FAIL AT LEARNING:
- Read once, never review
- No application
- Jump between topics
- Avoid difficulty

Invert: Review repeatedly. Apply immediately. Go deep. Embrace struggle.

Why inversion works:

Avoiding stupidity is easier than being brilliant. Reducing negatives often matters more than adding positives.

Munger: "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."
