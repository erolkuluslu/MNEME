TITLE: Compound Interest Applies to Everything
AUTHOR: Me

The insight:

Compound interest isn't just for money. It works for:
- Skills
- Knowledge
- Relationships
- Reputation
- Health

The math:

1% better daily = 37x better in a year (1.01^365)
1% worse daily = 0.03x (nearly zero) in a year

Small improvements compound. Small degradations compound too.

Applications:

LEARNING: Each concept builds on previous. Early investment pays off later.

FITNESS: Consistent small effort beats occasional massive effort.

CAREER: Skills stack. Reputation builds. Network grows.

RELATIONSHIPS: Small kindnesses compound into deep bonds. Small neglects compound into distance.

The trap:

We overvalue visible, immediate progress. Undervalue invisible, compounding gains.

Going to the gym today shows nothing. Going for 5 years transforms you.

Note to self: Play long games. Patient accumulation beats impatient optimization.
