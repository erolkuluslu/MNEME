The concept:

Most thinking is by analogy: "This is like that."

First principles: Break down to fundamental truths, build up from there.

Musk's example:

"Battery packs are expensive." (Analogy thinking accepts this)

First principles: What are batteries made of? Cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers. What do those cost on commodity markets? Much less than battery packs.

Therefore: Battery packs CAN be cheaper. The current price isn't a law of physics.

Where analogy fails:

"This is how it's always been done" is not a reason.
"Industry standard" assumes standards are optimal.
"Everyone does it this way" could mean everyone is wrong.

My application:

CAREER: "You need a CS degree to code" — first principles says you need to know how to code. Degree is one path, not the only path.

FITNESS: "Machines are safer than free weights" — first principles: What actually builds strength? Progressive overload. Both can work.

Caution:

First principles is effortful. Save it for important problems. Use analogy for routine decisions.
