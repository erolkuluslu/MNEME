TITLE: Integrative Complexity - Holding Multiple Truths
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2025-01-20

The concept:

Integrative complexity: The ability to hold multiple perspectives and see how they might all be partially true.

Low complexity: Black and white thinking. One right answer.
High complexity: Multiple valid viewpoints that can coexist.

Examples:

LOW: "AI is good" or "AI is bad"
HIGH: AI is a tool with potential for both benefit and harm, depending on development and deployment.

LOW: "Work hard" or "Work smart"
HIGH: Both are true at different times and for different tasks.

Why this matters:

Complex problems require complex thinking. Oversimplification misses nuance.

Most interesting questions don't have single answers. Premature certainty is often wrong.

The practice:

When I'm certain, ask: "What's the opposing view? What might they see that I'm missing?"

Steelman, don't strawman. Make the other side's best argument.

Hold beliefs loosely. Update with new information.

"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function." - Fitzgerald
