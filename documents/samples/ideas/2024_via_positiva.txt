The balance:

Via Negativa says: Subtract to improve.
Via Positiva says: Sometimes you need to add.

When to add:

- SKILLS: You can't subtract your way to competence. You need to learn.
- RELATIONSHIPS: Isolation isn't health. Add connection.
- MEANING: Removing problems doesn't create meaning. You must add purpose.
- HABITS: Quitting bad habits isn't enough. Replace with good ones.

The sequence:

Often: Subtract first (remove the bad), then add (introduce the good).

Quit sugar, then add vegetables.
Remove toxic people, then add good friends.
Stop bad habits, then build good ones.

The error:

Only subtracting leads to emptiness.
Only adding leads to clutter.

The art is knowing when to do which.
