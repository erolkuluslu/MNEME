TITLE: Local vs. Global Maximum
AUTHOR: Me

The concept:

LOCAL MAXIMUM: Best option within current constraints. Optimal locally but maybe not globally.

GLOBAL MAXIMUM: Best option overall, regardless of current position.

Getting to global maximum may require temporarily getting worse.

Career example:

Local max: Senior engineer at current company. Optimized this path.

Global max: Might require leaving, starting over in new domain, short-term income drop.

Stuck at local max because leaving feels like regression.

Life example:

Local max: Comfortable relationship that's "fine."

Global max: Might require ending it, being alone, to find something better.

The trap:

Incremental optimization keeps you at local max. Can't small-step your way to global max.

Sometimes you need to jump.

The question:

Am I at a local maximum? Would jumping to a lower point allow climbing to something higher?
