TITLE: Via Negativa - Subtraction Over Addition
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2021-09-20

The concept:

Improvement often comes from removal, not addition.

Health improves by removing bad habits, not adding supplements.
Writing improves by removing fluff, not adding words.
Life improves by removing toxic relationships, not adding acquaintances.

Taleb's insight:

We know more about what's wrong than what's right. It's easier to identify and remove negatives than to identify and add positives.

Smoking is definitely bad. No supplement is definitely good.

Applications:

DIET: Remove processed food before adding superfoods.

PRODUCTIVITY: Remove distractions before adding tools.

CODE: Remove complexity before adding features.

SCHEDULE: Remove obligations before adding activities.

The counter-instinct:

We're biased toward addition. "What should I add?" feels productive.

But the cluttered life needs pruning, not more stuff.

"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Saint-Exupéry
