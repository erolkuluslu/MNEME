TITLE: Regret Minimization Framework

Bezos's framework:

"I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.'"

The question:

When 80, will I regret NOT doing this?

Usually, we regret what we didn't do more than what we did.

How I use it:

BIG DECISIONS: Move cities? Start project? End relationship? Project forward.

The asymmetry:

Regret of commission (did something, failed): Fades with time
Regret of omission (didn't try): Grows with time

"What if?" haunts longer than "That didn't work."

My application:

Japan trip felt scary. Regret minimization: 80-year-old me would definitely regret never going.

Maya felt fast. Regret minimization: 80-year-old me would regret not pursuing love when I found it.

The bias toward action: When uncertain, do. You can recover from failure. You can't recover time.
