The concept:

First-order thinking: "What happens next?"
Second-order thinking: "And then what?"

Most people stop at first order. Edge comes from thinking further.

Example:

First order: "Raise prices → more revenue"
Second order: "More revenue → competitors undercut us → we lose market share → less revenue"

Example:

First order: "Work more hours → more output"
Second order: "More output → burnout → worse quality → mistakes → net negative"

Where I've failed to think second-order:

DIET: "Skip meals → lose weight" → Slow metabolism → binge later → gain weight

PRODUCTIVITY: "Say yes to everything" → Overcommitted → Exhausted → Quality suffers

RELATIONSHIPS: "Avoid difficult conversations" → Issues compound → Bigger explosion later

The practice:

Before decisions, ask: "And then what? And then what? And then what?"

Most problems come from first-order thinking meeting second-order consequences.
