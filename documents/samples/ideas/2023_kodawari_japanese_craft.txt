What is kodawari?

Japanese concept: An uncompromising commitment to excellence in craft. Going far beyond "good enough."

Examples I witnessed in Japan:

- Sushi chef who spent 10 years on rice before touching fish
- Ramen shop using single recipe for 40 years, perfecting daily
- Tea ceremony masters practicing the same movements for decades
- Knife makers taking weeks on single blade

The Western contrast:

We optimize for efficiency, scale, speed. "Move fast and break things."

Kodawari optimizes for quality, depth, mastery. Slow is fine if it's excellent.

What resonated:

I want to build things with kodawari. Not everything—that's impossible. But the things I choose to care about, I want to do them properly.

My bread is not just "functional." I'm pursuing craft.
My code is not just "working." I want it elegant.
My relationships are not just "adequate." I want them deep.

The question to ask:

"What would this look like if I applied kodawari?"

Then do that. Even if it takes longer. Especially if it takes longer.
