TITLE: Energy Audit - What Drains, What Fills
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2021-05-15

The practice:

Track what gives energy and what takes it.

People, activities, environments all have net energy effects.

My audit:

ENERGY GIVERS:
- Deep conversation
- Solving hard problems
- Exercise
- Nature
- Creating things
- Teaching

ENERGY DRAINS:
- Meetings without purpose
- Social media
- Small talk with strangers
- Clutter
- Unfinished tasks hanging over me
- News

NEUTRAL (depends):
- Large social gatherings
- Travel
- Certain people

The implication:

Design life to maximize givers, minimize drains.

Not always possible. But on the margin, choices matter.

The trap:

Drains often feel easier in the moment (scrolling vs. creating). Short-term ease, long-term drain.

Givers often require activation energy. But they pay back.
