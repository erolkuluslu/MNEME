Reading about the history of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides. The Melian Dialogue is chilling. "The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must." Realpolitik.

It's amazing how little human nature has changed in 2500 years. We are still driven by fear, honor, and interest. The trap of Thucydides. When a rising power threatens a ruling power, war is almost inevitable.

I'm also looking into the history of voting systems. First Past the Post vs Ranked Choice. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that no rank-order voting system can be designed that always satisfies three "fairness" criteria simultaneously. It's a mathematical proof that democracy is hard.

Reading history is humbling. Every generation thinks it's special. Every generation faces existential challenges. Most survive. Some don't. The wheel keeps turning.

The Peloponnesian War destroyed Athenian democracy. A 27-year conflict that exhausted both sides. Pride and miscalculation. The Sicilian Expedition was their Iraq War—a hubristic overreach that doomed them.

Are we making similar mistakes with AI? Moving too fast? Overconfident in our ability to control what we create? History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
