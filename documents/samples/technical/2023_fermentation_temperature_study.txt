TITLE: Temperature-Dependent Metabolic Shifts in Sourdough Fermentation: Optimizing Flavor and Structure

Abstract: This study characterizes the metabolic output of sourdough fermentation across temperatures from 20°C to 35°C. We demonstrate that temperature is the primary determinant of the lactic:acetic acid ratio, which directly affects bread flavor profile. Optimal flavor complexity was achieved at 24°C with a 12-hour fermentation.

1. Introduction

Artisanal bakers have long understood that temperature affects sourdough character. A cold fermentation yields milder, more yeast-forward bread, while warm fermentation produces sharp, tangy loaves. This study provides the biochemical explanation.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Starter Culture
San Francisco-style starter, 100% hydration, maintained for 5+ years.

2.2 Fermentation Conditions
- Temperatures: 20°C, 24°C, 28°C, 32°C, 35°C
- Duration: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 hours
- Flour: 50% bread flour, 50% whole wheat

2.3 Analysis
- HPLC for organic acids (lactic, acetic, propionic)
- GC-MS for volatile compounds
- Dough pH and total titratable acidity (TTA)

3. Results

3.1 Organic Acid Production

| Temp | Lactic Acid (mg/g) | Acetic Acid (mg/g) | Ratio |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 20°C | 4.2 | 2.8 | 1.5:1 |
| 24°C | 5.8 | 2.1 | 2.8:1 |
| 28°C | 7.1 | 1.4 | 5.1:1 |
| 32°C | 8.9 | 0.9 | 9.9:1 |
| 35°C | 9.2 | 0.7 | 13.1:1 |

3.2 Flavor Compound Analysis
Optimal flavor complexity (measured by volatile diversity) at 24°C:
- Ethyl acetate (fruity): peak at 24°C
- Diacetyl (buttery): peak at 20°C
- 3-methylbutanol (malty): peak at 28°C

3.3 Structural Effects
Higher temperatures produced:
- Faster rise (2x at 32°C vs 20°C)
- Weaker gluten network
- Denser crumb structure

4. Discussion

The temperature-dependent metabolic shift reflects bacterial ecology:
- Heterofermentative LAB (produce acetic acid) are more cold-tolerant
- Homofermentative LAB (produce lactic acid) dominate at higher temps
- Yeast activity peaks around 28°C but competes with bacteria

5. Practical Recommendations

For home bakers:
- Mild, complex flavor: 20-24°C, 12-16 hours
- Tangy, aggressive flavor: 28-32°C, 6-8 hours
- Use refrigeration (4°C) to extend fermentation without excessive acidification

6. Conclusion

Temperature is the master variable in sourdough fermentation. Understanding its effects empowers bakers to achieve consistent, intentional flavor profiles.
