"The obstacle is the way." I keep coming back to Marcus Aurelius. In 2021, I used Stoicism to survive startup stress. Now, I use it to navigate success. It's harder, in a way. Success makes you soft. It makes you think you control everything. But you don't.

The market can turn. The tech can change. A new model can make your product obsolete overnight. The only thing you control is your character. Your virtue. I'm trying to practice "Amor Fati" - love of fate. Whatever happens, accept it and turn it into fuel.

I see so many people in this industry losing their minds over the speed of AI progress. They are anxious, fearful. But the Stoic view is to look at it objectively. It is just change. Nature is change. "Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight." We are part of a grand evolution. We play our part, and then we exit the stage. It's liberating to remember that.

Re-reading the Meditations alongside Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" has been powerful. Both authors faced existential challenges—Marcus leading an empire through plague and war, Frankl surviving concentration camps. Both found that meaning and virtue were the only stable ground.

In the face of AI that might surpass us, what remains? Our humanity. Our choices. Our relationships. The Stoics were right: external things are indifferent. What matters is how we respond.
