TITLE: Increasing Your Luck Surface Area
AUTHOR: Me

The concept:

Luck = doing things × telling people

The more you do (projects, experiments, attempts), the more opportunities for luck.

The more you tell people (writing, sharing, talking), the more others can connect you to opportunities.

Luck isn't random. It's partly manufactured.

How to increase surface area:

1. DO MORE THINGS: Start projects. Experiment. Ship.
2. SHARE: Blog, tweet, talk at meetups. Make your work visible.
3. MEET PEOPLE: Network. Every connection is a potential lucky break.
4. SAY YES: Especially early in career. You don't know which yes leads somewhere.

My experience:

The job I got came from a blog post I almost didn't publish. Someone read it, reached out. Luck? Partially. But I created the conditions.

The formula:

Luck Surface Area = (Doing × Telling) × Time

Compound interest applies. Over time, small increases add up.
