TITLE: Parkinson's Law - Time Expands to Fill Space
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2021-11-20

The law:

"Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."

Give yourself a week, it takes a week. Give yourself a day, it takes a day (mostly).

Implications:

DEADLINES HELP: Even artificial ones create focus.

CONSTRAINTS ARE GOOD: Less time forces prioritization.

PERFECTIONISM IS ENABLED BY TIME: Infinite time → infinite tweaking.

How I use it:

Set tight deadlines, even for personal projects. "This draft done by Friday" beats "whenever it's ready."

The challenge:

Too tight → stress and poor quality
Too loose → Parkinson's law kicks in

The sweet spot: Slightly uncomfortable but achievable.
