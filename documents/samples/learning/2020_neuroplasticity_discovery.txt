TITLE: The Brain Can Change - Neuroplasticity
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2020-07-15

The insight that blew my mind:

The brain isn't fixed. It changes based on what we do, think, and practice.

"Neurons that fire together wire together."

This means:
- Skills can be learned at any age
- Habits physically reshape neural pathways
- What we repeatedly do becomes who we are

Implications:

LEARNING: The struggle is the point. Difficulty triggers neuroplasticity. Easy = no growth.

HABITS: Bad habits strengthen with repetition. Good ones too. Choose wisely.

THERAPY: Cognitive patterns can be rewired. Not just managed—actually changed.

AGING: "Use it or lose it" is literally true. Mental exercise matters.

My takeaway:

I'm not stuck with the brain I have. Every choice is a vote for who I'm becoming.

Learning is hard because it's supposed to be. That's where growth happens.
