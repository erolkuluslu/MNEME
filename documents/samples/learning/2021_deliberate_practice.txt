TITLE: Deliberate Practice - How Experts Get Good
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2021-01-20

Key insight from Ericsson:

10,000 hours is misunderstood. It's not just time—it's deliberate practice.

What makes practice deliberate:

1. SPECIFIC GOALS: Not "practice guitar" but "nail this transition at 120 bpm"

2. FOCUSED ATTENTION: Full concentration, no multitasking

3. IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK: Know if you did it right

4. OUTSIDE COMFORT ZONE: Easy practice = no improvement

5. MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS: Experts "see" their domain differently

Where I fail at this:

GYM: Sometimes I go through motions, not deliberately pushing.

CODING: I solve problems I already know. Should tackle harder ones.

BREAD: Comfort recipes vs. challenging new techniques.

The fix:

Identify the specific skill to improve. Design focused practice. Get feedback. Repeat.

Not more practice. Better practice.
