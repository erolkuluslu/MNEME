What is synthesis?

Taking disparate information and combining it into something new.

Not just knowing things. Connecting things.

Why it matters:

Information is abundant. Anyone can access it. Synthesis is rare. That's where value is.

AI can retrieve. AI can summarize. But AI (so far) struggles with truly novel synthesis.

How to develop:

1. READ WIDELY: Connections come from diverse inputs

2. WRITE: Writing forces synthesis. "What does this mean together?"

3. TEACH: Explaining synthesizes for you and others

4. CROSS-POLLINATE: Apply ideas from one domain to another

5. QUESTION: "What does X have to do with Y?"

My practice:

This note system is synthesis practice. Every saved insight gets connected to others.

The network of notes is a synthesis engine.
