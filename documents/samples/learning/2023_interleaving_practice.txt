The counterintuitive finding:

Blocked practice (AAABBBCCC) feels effective but isn't.
Interleaved practice (ABCABCABC) feels harder but produces better retention.

Why:

Interleaving forces the brain to:
- Retrieve different strategies
- Discriminate between problem types
- Consolidate varied knowledge

Blocked practice gives false confidence. You get good at the current thing, then forget it when context switches.

Applications:

CODING: Don't do 20 similar problems. Mix SQL, Python, algorithms.

GYM: Varied movements in same session (which I already do).

LEARNING: Study multiple subjects in same session, not one at a time.

The feeling trap:

Interleaving feels inefficient. Progress seems slower. But testing shows better long-term retention.

Trust the process, not the feeling.
