Core concept:

Ultralearning: A strategy for aggressive, self-directed learning.

The 9 principles:

1. METALEARNING: Map the territory first. How is this subject learned?

2. FOCUS: Deep concentration. No distractions.

3. DIRECTNESS: Learn by doing the thing, not adjacent skills.

4. DRILL: Attack the weakest point directly.

5. RETRIEVAL: Test yourself. Don't just review.

6. FEEDBACK: Get real feedback, not just validation.

7. RETENTION: Use spaced repetition.

8. INTUITION: Build deep understanding, not surface memorization.

9. EXPERIMENTATION: Try different approaches. Find what works.

What I'm applying:

DIRECTNESS: Instead of reading about coding, code. Instead of watching guitar tutorials, play.

DRILLING: Identify specific weak points and attack them.

RETRIEVAL: Stop re-reading. Quiz myself instead.

The meta-lesson:

Learning how to learn is the highest-leverage skill. Improve the process, improve everything.
