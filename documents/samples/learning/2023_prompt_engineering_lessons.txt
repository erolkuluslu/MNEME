TITLE: What I've Learned About Prompting AI
AUTHOR: Me

Lessons from 6 months of heavy AI use:

1. BE SPECIFIC
Bad: "Write code for user auth"
Good: "Write a Python function that validates JWT tokens and extracts user_id from the payload."

2. SHOW DON'T TELL
Give examples of what you want. AI learns from patterns.

3. STEP BY STEP
"Let's think step by step" actually improves reasoning. Breaking problems down helps.

4. ROLE ASSIGNMENT
"You are an expert Python developer with 20 years experience" activates different knowledge.

5. OUTPUT FORMAT
"Respond in JSON format with fields: summary, sentiment, key_points"
Explicit structure reduces ambiguity.

6. ITERATE
First response is rarely perfect. Refine. Ask follow-ups. Treat it as conversation, not oracle.

What still trips me up:
- AI is confidently wrong sometimes. Verify important stuff.
- Recent information may be hallucinated.
- Complex multi-step tasks need breaking down.

The meta-skill: Knowing when AI helps and when it doesn't.
