Key insights:

1. WEALTH IS WHAT YOU DON'T SEE
"Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money."

The neighbor with the nice car might be broke. Wealth is invisible—it's the money not spent.

2. REASONABLE > RATIONAL
Perfect investment strategy you can't stick to loses to imperfect strategy you can. Psychology beats math.

3. TAILS DRIVE EVERYTHING
A tiny number of events drive most outcomes. A few investments, a few days in the market, a few career moves.

4. ROOM FOR ERROR
Things will go wrong. Plan for it. Emergency fund isn't just math—it's peace of mind.

5. ENOUGH
"The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving."

What's your enough? Define it. Then stop.

My "enough": Financial security, meaningful work, time with people I love, health. Not a yacht.
