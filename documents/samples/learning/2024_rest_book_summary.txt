Counter-intuitive thesis:

Rest is not the absence of work. Rest is a skill, a practice, and essential for great work.

Historical evidence:

Many prolific creators worked only 4-5 focused hours per day. Darwin. Poincaré. Hardy.

The rest of the day: Walking. Napping. Hobbies.

Not despite the rest. Because of the rest.

Why rest works:

1. INCUBATION: The unconscious mind continues working. Eureka moments during rest.

2. RECOVERY: Mental energy depletes. Rest replenishes.

3. PERSPECTIVE: Distance from problems allows fresh seeing.

Types of rest:

- Sleep (obvious but neglected)
- Walking (active recovery, stimulates thinking)
- Napping (power nap restores focus)
- Vacations (extended detachment)
- Sabbaticals (deep recovery)
- Hobbies (active rest, uses different faculties)

My changes:

- Protect weekends more seriously
- Walking meetings instead of sitting
- No guilt about downtime
- Exercise as productive rest

The mindset shift: Rest is investment, not indulgence.
