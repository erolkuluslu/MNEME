TITLE: The Power of Peripheral Learning

Key concept:

We don't just learn from focused study. Exposure matters even without attention.

"Peripheral learning" happens when:
- Overhearing conversations
- Background music/language
- Passive reading
- Environmental immersion

The study cited:

Students exposed to math terms in background signage performed better on tests, even when they didn't consciously notice the signs.

My reflection:

This validates environmental design. What I'm surrounded by matters.

Applications:
- Posters with quotes I want to internalize
- Ambient foreign language audio
- Books visible, not hidden
- Default browser tabs to learning resources

Environment > willpower for behavior change.
