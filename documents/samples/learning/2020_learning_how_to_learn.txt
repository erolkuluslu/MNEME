From Barbara Oakley's course:

FOCUSED vs DIFFUSE MODE:
- Focused: Tight concentration on familiar patterns
- Diffuse: Relaxed, letting mind wander, making new connections

Both needed. Alternate between them. Stuck in focused? Take a walk.

CHUNKING:
- Break learning into chunks
- Practice until automatic
- Chunks free working memory for higher-level thinking

THE POMODORO TECHNIQUE:
- 25 min focused work
- 5 min break
- Repeat

Works because: Short enough to commit, builds the habit of starting.

INTERLEAVING:
- Mix different types of problems
- Feels harder, works better

SLEEP:
- Critical for memory consolidation
- Don't skimp before tests

EXERCISE:
- Enhances learning and memory
- Move your body, help your brain

The meta-insight: Learning is a skill that can be improved. This course is high-leverage.
