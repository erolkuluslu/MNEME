TITLE: What Does AI Mean for Human Meaning?
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2025-02-18

The question I keep coming back to:

If AI can do everything, what's left for humans?

My current thinking:

1. PROCESS MATTERS
A poem I struggle to write means more than one AI generates. The effort encodes meaning. The journey is the point.

2. RELATIONSHIP MATTERS
Talking to Maya is meaningful because it's Maya. Her history. Her quirks. Our shared experiences. AI conversation is useful but different.

3. EMBODIMENT MATTERS
Sourdough has meaning because I feel the dough. The body is involved. AI describes bread but can't taste it. Experience requires a body.

4. CHOICE MATTERS
Viktor Frankl found meaning in concentration camps. Meaning survives anything if you choose it. AI doesn't choose—it predicts.

The synthesis:

AI is not meaningful or meaningless. It's a tool. The meaning we make with it is up to us.

I'll keep building. Keep baking. Keep lifting. Keep loving.

Meaning is in the living, not the output.
