What is craft mindset?

Caring about quality for its own sake. Not just "does it work?" but "is it good?"

Where I see it:

- Japanese artisans spending years on one skill
- Programmers who refactor working code for elegance
- Bakers obsessing over crumb structure
- Writers revising and revising

Where I lack it:

- Shipping "good enough" when I could do better
- Skipping the polish to move on
- Caring more about done than good

Why craft matters:

1. SATISFACTION: Quick work feels empty. Craft feels meaningful.

2. SKILL BUILDING: Pushing for quality develops ability.

3. REPUTATION: Quality compounds into reputation.

4. SELF-RESPECT: You know when you've phoned it in.

The balance:

Can't craft everything. Time is limited. Choose what to craft. Accept "good enough" on the rest.

But on the things I choose: Craft deeply.
