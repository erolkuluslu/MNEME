The dichotomy of control:

"Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions." - Epictetus

What this means practically:

IN MY CONTROL:
- My effort
- My reactions
- My character
- How I treat others

NOT IN MY CONTROL:
- Other people's opinions
- The economy
- Traffic
- Weather
- The past
- Most of the future

My anxiety comes from trying to control the uncontrollable. When I catch myself worrying, I ask: "Is this in my control?"

If yes: Act.
If no: Accept.

It's simple but not easy. Practice helps. The Stoics were right—this is a mental training, not just philosophy.
