The concept:

Share what you learn as you learn it. Blog posts, tweets, talks. Don't wait until you're an expert.

Benefits:

1. ACCOUNTABILITY: Public commitment motivates follow-through

2. FEEDBACK: Others correct mistakes, add perspectives

3. NETWORKING: Fellow learners find you

4. TEACHING: Explaining solidifies understanding

5. DOCUMENTATION: Future self will thank you

The fear:

"What if I'm wrong? What if it's obvious? What if real experts laugh?"

The reframe:

You're not claiming expertise. You're documenting a journey. "Here's what I learned today" is humble and helpful.

My experiment:

Started sharing learning notes on Twitter. Small audience, but responses have been encouraging. Corrections improved my understanding.

The mantra: "Document, don't create." Lower barrier than trying to be original.
