What is flow?

That state of complete absorption where time disappears. Athletes call it "the zone." When I'm deep in coding and suddenly it's 3 hours later.

Conditions for flow:

1. CLEAR GOALS: Know what you're trying to do
2. IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK: Know if you're succeeding
3. CHALLENGE-SKILL BALANCE: Not too easy (boredom), not too hard (anxiety)

The sweet spot: Challenge slightly exceeds current skill. You're stretched but not overwhelmed.

Where I experience flow:
- Coding complex features
- Playing guitar (when I know the song)
- Baking bread (shaping, especially)
- Rock climbing

Where I don't:
- Email
- Meetings
- Social media

Insight: Flow feels like happiness, but it's actually absorption. You're too engaged to evaluate how you feel. Happiness is assessed afterward.

Life design question: How can I structure more flow opportunities?
