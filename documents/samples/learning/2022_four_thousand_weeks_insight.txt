The premise:

Average lifespan = 4,000 weeks. That's it. Productivity culture promises if you optimize enough, you'll "get on top of everything." You won't. There's always more.

The paradox:

The better you get at time management, the more demands rush in to fill the space. Inbox zero creates space for more emails.

What actually matters:

1. FINITUDE: Accept you can't do everything. Choosing means losing. That's okay.

2. ATTENTION: What you attend to is your life. Attention is not a resource to optimize—it's the substance of existence.

3. COSMIC INSIGNIFICANCE: You are tiny in space and time. This is liberating, not depressing. The pressure is off.

Key quote: "You have to accept that there will always be too much to do. You have to let go of the fantasy of one day getting it all done."

My shift: Stop optimizing for more. Start choosing what matters and accepting limits.

This book felt like therapy.
