TITLE: Transfer Learning Applies to Humans Too

The AI concept:

Transfer learning: Train a model on one task, apply to a related task. Prior knowledge accelerates new learning.

Human parallel:

Skills transfer. Math helps with coding. Music helps with language. Writing helps with thinking.

The hidden curriculum:

Every skill teaches meta-skills:
- Learning itself
- Problem-solving patterns
- Frustration tolerance
- Seeing connections

This is why diverse learning beats narrow specialization early on.

What has transferred for me:

GYM → CODING: Progressive overload, consistency beats intensity, recovery matters

BREAD → WORK: Patience, reading feedback, trusting the process

MEDITATION → EVERYTHING: The pause between stimulus and response

PHILOSOPHY → AI: Ethics, consciousness, meaning questions

The takeaway:

Nothing is wasted. Every skill contributes to the whole.

Learn broadly. The connections will emerge.
