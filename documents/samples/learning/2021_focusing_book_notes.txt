The core technique:

Focusing: Paying attention to the "felt sense"—the body's subtle knowing about a situation.

The steps:

1. CLEAR A SPACE: Set aside concerns, create inner quiet

2. FELT SENSE: What does this situation feel like in my body?

3. HANDLE: What word or image captures this feeling?

4. RESONATING: Does the handle fit? Check with the body.

5. ASKING: What is it about this situation that makes me feel this?

6. RECEIVING: Accept whatever comes, without judgment

Why this matters:

We think in words. But the body knows things the mind doesn't. That "gut feeling" is information.

My experience:

When stuck on a decision, I ask my body. There's often a subtle feeling—tightness, openness, resistance.

Not instead of thinking. In addition to thinking.

The body doesn't lie the way the mind can rationalize.
