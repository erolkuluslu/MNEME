What is Zettelkasten?

German for "slip box." Niklas Luhmann's note system that produced 70+ books.

Core principles:

1. ATOMIC NOTES: One idea per note. Self-contained.

2. LINKS: Connect notes to other notes. The network matters.

3. OWN WORDS: Always rewrite in your own words. No copying.

4. EMERGENT STRUCTURE: Organization emerges from connections, not predetermined categories.

Why it works:

Traditional notes are siloed. Zettelkasten is networked. Ideas from different domains connect, spark new thoughts.

My implementation:

Using Obsidian. Each note is atomic. Links created generously.

Unexpected benefit: Stumbling across old notes while linking new ones. Rediscovery.

The insight:

Note-taking isn't just storing information. It's building an external thinking partner.

The network of notes becomes a second brain that can surprise you.
