TITLE: The Paradox of Choice
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2025-01-25

The problem:

More choice doesn't make us happier. Often the opposite.

Why:

1. DECISION FATIGUE: Choices deplete mental energy
2. OPPORTUNITY COST: We imagine what we didn't choose
3. REGRET POTENTIAL: More options = more ways to regret
4. EXPECTATIONS RISE: With many options, we expect to find "the best"

The study:

Jam experiment: More varieties displayed → fewer purchases and less satisfaction.

Solutions:

1. SATISFICE: "Good enough" beats endless optimization
2. LIMIT OPTIONS: Artificially constrain choices
3. MAKE DECISIONS FINAL: Stop reconsidering
4. GRATITUDE: Focus on what you have, not what you chose against

My application:

Restaurant menus: Pick quickly, don't second-guess.

Career: Commit, don't perpetually compare to unlived paths.

Relationships: Choose, then invest. Stop wondering about alternatives.

The wisdom: Freedom isn't unlimited choice. It's choosing well and committing.
