The three-pass approach someone taught me:

PASS 1 (5-10 min):
- Title, abstract, introduction
- Section headings
- Conclusions
- Skim figures

Goal: Should I read deeper? What's the big picture?

PASS 2 (30-60 min):
- Read thoroughly but skip proofs/details
- Understand figures and diagrams
- Note unfamiliar terms/references
- Summarize key points

Goal: Understand the contribution

PASS 3 (hours):
- Re-implement or deeply trace logic
- Question every assumption
- Identify strengths and weaknesses

Goal: True understanding, ready to critique

My mistake before:

I tried to understand everything in one pass. Got stuck on page 3. Gave up.

Three passes lets me triage. Most papers only need pass 1. Some need pass 2. Few need pass 3.

The meta-skill: Knowing when to go deeper and when to move on.
