The insight:

Writing isn't just recording thoughts. It's generating them.

"I don't know what I think until I write it down." — Joan Didion

Why writing clarifies:

1. Forces linear structure on tangled thoughts
2. Reveals logical gaps
3. Makes implicit assumptions explicit
4. Creates distance to evaluate ideas

How I use it:

MORNING PAGES: Stream of consciousness. No filter. Clears mental clutter.

PROBLEM-SOLVING: Write out the problem. Often the solution emerges mid-sentence.

LEARNING: Summarize in my own words. If I can't, I don't understand.

DECISIONS: Pro/con lists, yes, but also "explain the decision to future me."

The blog experiment:

Started writing publicly. Forces even more clarity—I can't hide behind vagueness when others will read it.

Takeaway: When stuck, write. The act of writing IS the thinking, not just its output.
