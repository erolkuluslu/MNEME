TITLE: Why Your Brain Gets Overwhelmed
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2024-07-20

The concept:

Working memory is limited. Roughly 4 chunks at a time. Overload it and learning stops.

Three types of cognitive load:

1. INTRINSIC: Inherent complexity of the material. Can't reduce, only scaffold.

2. EXTRANEOUS: Bad design, distractions, irrelevant information. Reduce this.

3. GERMANE: Effort to build mental models. Increase this.

Practical implications:

LEARNING: Break complex topics into pieces. Don't overwhelm working memory.

TEACHING: Remove extraneous info. Focus on the essential.

DESIGN: Clear interfaces reduce cognitive load.

ENVIRONMENT: Distractions add load. Minimize them.

Why multitasking fails:

Each context switch adds load. Partial attention on multiple things = none done well.

Single-tasking is cognitive hygiene.

My changes:

- One browser tab at a time when learning
- Clear desk, clear mind
- New concepts in small doses
- Build up complexity gradually
