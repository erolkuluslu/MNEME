Things I've learned AI is bad at:

1. RECENT INFORMATION
Knowledge cutoffs are real. It confidently gives outdated info. Always verify anything time-sensitive.

2. COUNTING AND MATH
Ask it to count words or do complex arithmetic. Often wrong. It's pattern matching, not calculating.

3. SELF-KNOWLEDGE
"I don't have emotions" while clearly having preferences. It doesn't really know what it is.

4. NOVEL REASONING
It can remix training data brilliantly. Truly novel ideas are rare. It's a very good interpolator.

5. PERSISTENT MEMORY
Each conversation starts fresh. It doesn't remember previous chats (without RAG).

6. SPATIAL REASONING
Describe a room and ask what's left of the table. Often wrong.

7. KNOWING WHAT IT DOESN'T KNOW
Confidently wrong > admitting uncertainty. I always verify claims I care about.

How I use AI effectively:

- Brainstorming partner, not oracle
- First draft generator, not final product
- Explain concepts, not cite facts
- Code assistant, always reviewed
- Search starting point, then verify

The right mental model: Brilliant intern with unreliable memory. Useful, not trustworthy.
