The two systems:

System 1: Fast, automatic, intuitive. Handles most daily decisions. Prone to biases.

System 2: Slow, deliberate, effortful. Required for complex problems. Lazy—avoids engagement when possible.

Key biases I notice in myself:

ANCHORING: First number influences everything. When I hear a salary range, I fixate on the anchor. Negotiation lesson: make the first offer.

AVAILABILITY: I judge probability by how easily examples come to mind. Plane crashes feel common because they're memorable. Statistically rare.

LOSS AVERSION: Losing $100 hurts more than gaining $100 feels good. I hold losing investments too long, hoping to break even.

CONFIRMATION BIAS: I seek information that confirms what I already believe. Actively seek disconfirming evidence.

Practical application: Before big decisions, ask "What would System 2 say if I forced it to engage?" Write out pros/cons. Slow down.

This book is dense. Will need to re-read.
