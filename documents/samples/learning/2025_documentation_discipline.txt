TITLE: Why Documentation Matters
AUTHOR: Me
DATE: 2025-02-28

The lesson:

The best code in the world is useless if no one can understand it.

What documentation does:

1. FOR OTHERS: Lets them use your work

2. FOR FUTURE YOU: You will forget why you did things

3. FOR THINKING: Writing doc clarifies the system

When to document:

- As you build (not after)
- When you figure something out
- When you decide something (include the why)

What to document:

- Why, not just what
- Examples, not just reference
- Edge cases and gotchas
- How to get started

The discipline:

Documentation feels like overhead. It's not. It's multiplier.

Undocumented work dies when you leave. Documented work lives on.

My rule: Nothing is done until it's documented.
