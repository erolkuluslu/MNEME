The forgetting curve:

We forget 50% within an hour, 70% within 24 hours. Without review, knowledge evaporates.

The solution: Review at increasing intervals

Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 30 → Day 90

Each successful review extends the interval. Each failure shortens it.

Why it works:

Memory strengthens at the moment of almost-forgetting. Too early = wasted review. Too late = forgotten.

Spaced repetition hits the sweet spot.

Tools I use:

Anki for flashcards. But the principle applies to any review:
- Revisit notes periodically
- Teach concepts to others
- Apply learning to projects

What I'm spacing:

- Japanese vocabulary (Anki)
- Key concepts from books (periodic note review)
- Important dates/facts (calendar reminders)

The insight: Learning without retention is wasted time. Build review into the system.
