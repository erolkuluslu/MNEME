Core thesis: 

"Deep Work: Professional activities performed in distraction-free concentration that push cognitive capabilities to their limit. These create new value, improve skill, and are hard to replicate."

The opposite is "shallow work" - emails, meetings, admin tasks. Necessary but not valuable.

Key insight: Deep work is becoming rare AND valuable at the same time. If you can do it, you have a superpower.

The rules I'm implementing:

1. Work Deeply - Schedule deep work blocks. Protect them fiercely.

2. Embrace Boredom - Train your brain to resist distraction. Don't reach for your phone every idle moment.

3. Quit Social Media - Not literally, but be ruthless. "Does this add substantial value?"

4. Drain the Shallows - Schedule every minute. Audit time. Cut the crap.

My experiment: 2 hours of deep work every morning before checking email. It's hard. But the output quality is noticeably better.

This book changed how I think about attention.
