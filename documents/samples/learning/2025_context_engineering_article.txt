TITLE: Context Engineering - The New Skill

What I've learned about working with AI:

It's not just prompting—it's context engineering.

What information to include, how to structure it, what to omit. The context shapes the output.

Components of good context:

1. SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS: Who is the AI in this interaction? What constraints?

2. RELEVANT INFORMATION: Background the AI needs. Not everything—relevant things.

3. EXAMPLES: Show, don't tell. Demonstrate the format you want.

4. CLEAR REQUEST: What specifically do you want?

What I've noticed:

- Important information should be at the start and end. Middle gets less attention.
- Structure matters. Clear sections, headers, delineation.
- Less is often more. Irrelevant context confuses.

The meta-insight:

As AI gets more powerful, the skill shifts from "doing things" to "orchestrating AI doing things."

Taste, judgment, editorial skill, knowing what questions to ask—these become more valuable, not less.

Context engineering is how humans stay relevant in an AI world.
