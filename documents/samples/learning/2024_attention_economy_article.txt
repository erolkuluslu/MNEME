Key concept: The attention economy

Your attention is the product. Apps compete to capture and hold it. Their business model depends on you being distracted.

Techniques they use:
- Infinite scroll (no stopping cue)
- Variable rewards (slot machine psychology)
- Social validation (likes, comments)
- FOMO triggers (what are you missing?)

The quote that hit:

"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product."

My reflection:

I've noticed my attention span shrinking. I can't read like I used to. I reach for my phone in every idle moment. This isn't weakness—it's the intended outcome of billion-dollar engineering.

What I'm doing:
- Deleted Twitter and Instagram apps
- Phone in grayscale
- Scheduled "offline" time
- Physical books, not Kindle (less distraction temptation)

The battle for attention is the battle for my life. What I attend to becomes my experience. I refuse to let algorithms choose for me.
