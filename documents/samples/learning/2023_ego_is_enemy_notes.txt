The thesis:

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. It undermines success at every stage.

Three stages:

ASPIRING: Ego makes us talk instead of do. We want credit before we've earned it.

SUCCESS: Ego makes us believe our own hype. We stop learning. We become entitled.

FAILURE: Ego prevents honest assessment. We blame others. We can't adapt.

Key passages:

"Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive."

"Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them."

"Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this."

My application:

I notice ego most when I'm defensive. When criticism stings disproportionately. When I want recognition.

The antidote: Focus on the work. The work matters. The ego doesn't.

Still working on this. Probably always will be.
