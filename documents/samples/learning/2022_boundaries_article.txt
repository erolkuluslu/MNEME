What are boundaries?

Clear limits on what you will and won't accept. Not walls—filters.

Why we struggle:

- People-pleasing conditioning
- Fear of conflict
- Guilt about prioritizing self
- Unclear on our own needs

Signs of poor boundaries:

- Resentment (doing things you don't want)
- Exhaustion (giving too much)
- Feeling taken advantage of
- Difficulty saying no

How to set boundaries:

1. IDENTIFY: What do I need? What drains me?
2. COMMUNICATE: Clear, direct, not apologetic
3. ENFORCE: Follow through, or the boundary is meaningless

The key phrase:

"I'm not able to" instead of "I don't want to"

Less negotiable. Less guilt-inducing.

My work:

I'm a recovering people-pleaser. Saying no feels rude. But every yes to others is a no to something else.

Boundaries are self-respect made visible.
