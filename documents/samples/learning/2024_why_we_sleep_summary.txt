The scary stats:

- Less than 6 hours: 4.2x more likely to catch a cold
- One week of 5-hour nights: Blood sugar like a pre-diabetic
- 17 hours awake: Cognitive impairment equivalent to 0.05% BAC

What sleep does:

1. MEMORY CONSOLIDATION: Move learning from short-term to long-term. Sleep after studying, not before tests.

2. BRAIN CLEANING: Glymphatic system clears toxins. Sleep deprivation = Alzheimer's risk factor.

3. EMOTIONAL REGULATION: REM sleep processes emotions. Poor sleep = irritability, anxiety, depression.

4. PHYSICAL RECOVERY: Growth hormone released during deep sleep. Athletes who sleep more perform better.

My changes:

- 8 hours minimum, not negotiable
- No caffeine after 2pm
- Phone out of bedroom
- Cool room (65°F)
- Consistent wake time, even weekends

The mindset shift: Sleep is not lost time. It's productive time for the brain.
