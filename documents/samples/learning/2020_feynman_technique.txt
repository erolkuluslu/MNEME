Richard Feynman's learning method:

1. STUDY: Learn the concept
2. TEACH: Explain it like you're teaching a child
3. IDENTIFY GAPS: Where did you struggle to explain?
4. SIMPLIFY: Go back, fill gaps, simplify further

Why it works:

Simple explanations require deep understanding. Jargon hides confusion.

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

How I use it:

After learning something new, I write an explanation in my notes as if teaching someone.

Example: Instead of "Gradient descent minimizes the loss function," I write "It's like walking downhill blindfolded—you feel which way is down and take small steps."

The test: Could a smart 12-year-old understand this?

Where this helped:

Neural networks finally clicked when I tried to explain them to my mom. My confused attempts revealed my own confusion.
