Key techniques:

MIRRORING: Repeat the last 3 words they said. Encourages them to elaborate.

LABELING: "It sounds like..." / "It seems like..." Name their emotion. Defuses it.

CALIBRATED QUESTIONS: "How am I supposed to do that?" / "What's the biggest challenge you face?" Open questions that feel collaborative.

TACTICAL EMPATHY: Understand their perspective, even if you don't agree. Not sympathy—strategic understanding.

"NO" IS VALUABLE: Get them to say no. It makes them feel safe and in control. "Is this a bad time?" is better than "Is this a good time?"

"THAT'S RIGHT": The goal is to get them to say "that's right" about your understanding of their position. Not "you're right" (which can be dismissive).

My application:

These work in everyday conversations, not just negotiations.

With Maya: Labeling emotions helps. "It seems like you're frustrated about..." validates before problem-solving.

At work: Calibrated questions in disagreements. "How would you see this working?" instead of arguing.

The meta-insight: Negotiation is emotional, not just rational. Address emotions first.
