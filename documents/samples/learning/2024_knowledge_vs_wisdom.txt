TITLE: Knowledge vs. Wisdom

The distinction:

KNOWLEDGE: Knowing facts, information, how things work.

WISDOM: Knowing what matters, when to act, how to live.

You can have knowledge without wisdom (book-smart, life-dumb).
Wisdom without much knowledge is rare but possible (the wise elder).

Why wisdom is harder:

Knowledge can be taught. Wisdom must be earned through experience.

Knowledge is additive. Wisdom often requires unlearning.

Knowledge is confident. Wisdom knows its limits.

How wisdom develops:

- Suffering (teaches what matters)
- Reflection (processes experience into insight)
- Time (some things take years to understand)
- Humility (admitting ignorance is the start)

My worry:

I pursue knowledge. Do I pursue wisdom?

Knowledge is measurable. Books read, skills gained. Wisdom is subtle.

The question: Am I becoming wiser, not just smarter?
