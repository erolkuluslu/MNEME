TITLE: Why You're Not Productive During the Pandemic (And Why That's OK)
AUTHOR: Saved from NYT

Key quotes I highlighted:

"You are not working from home. You are at your home during a crisis trying to work."

"Productivity culture tells us our worth is measured by output. A pandemic reminds us that survival itself is an achievement."

"The brain cannot function optimally under chronic stress. Executive function—planning, focus, decision-making—degrades first."

My reflection:

This article was permission I needed. I've been beating myself up for not being productive. But we're living through a historic trauma. Survival is the goal.

I'm adjusting my standards. "Good enough" is good enough right now. I'll save ambition for when the world isn't on fire.
