The framework:

CUE → CRAVING → RESPONSE → REWARD

To build habits, make them:
1. Obvious (cue)
2. Attractive (craving)
3. Easy (response)
4. Satisfying (reward)

To break habits, invert:
1. Invisible
2. Unattractive
3. Difficult
4. Unsatisfying

What I've applied:

GYM HABIT:
- Obvious: Gym bag packed by door
- Attractive: Post-workout smoothie reward
- Easy: Gym is on my commute
- Satisfying: Track progress in app

PHONE HABIT (breaking):
- Invisible: Charger in another room overnight
- Unattractive: Grayscale mode
- Difficult: Deleted social apps
- Unsatisfying: Time tracking shows wasted hours

Key quote: "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

The 1% better principle: Tiny improvements compound. Don't aim for transformation. Aim for slight improvement, repeatedly.
