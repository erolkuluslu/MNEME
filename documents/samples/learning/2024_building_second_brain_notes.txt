Core concept: Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them. Offload to a trusted system.

The PARA method:

P - Projects: Active, deadline-driven
A - Areas: Ongoing responsibilities (health, finances, career)
R - Resources: Topics of interest
A - Archives: Completed/inactive

The capture habit:

Don't trust your memory. When something resonates, capture it immediately. Process later.

Progressive summarization:

1. Bold important passages
2. Highlight within bold
3. Executive summary
4. Remix into new ideas

The insight: Every time you touch a note, distill it further. Notes should get more valuable over time, not less.

What I'm implementing:

1. Single capture tool (Notion for me)
2. Weekly review to process inbox
3. Project-centric organization
4. Tag for future self

Quote: "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."

This connects to my AI project. RAG over my second brain = searchable, synthesizable knowledge.
