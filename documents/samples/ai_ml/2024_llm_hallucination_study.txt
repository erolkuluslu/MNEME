Abstract: This comprehensive study analyzes hallucination patterns in large language models (LLMs) across 50,000 generated responses. We identify three primary causes: knowledge gaps, over-generalization from training data, and attention distribution failures. Our proposed detection framework achieves 87% accuracy in identifying hallucinated content.

1. Introduction

Hallucination—the generation of fluent but factually incorrect content—represents one of the most significant challenges in deploying LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks. Unlike earlier neural network errors that were obviously wrong, LLM hallucinations are insidious: they read convincingly and are difficult to detect without external verification.

2. Taxonomy of Hallucinations

2.1 Intrinsic Hallucinations
- Contradicting the source material
- Self-contradictions within responses
- Logical inconsistencies

2.2 Extrinsic Hallucinations  
- Fabricated facts not in training data
- Invented citations and references
- Made-up entities (people, places, events)

3. Experimental Setup

We evaluated GPT-4, Claude, and Llama-2 across:
- Factual QA (Natural Questions, TriviaQA)
- Summarization (CNN/DailyMail)
- Knowledge-grounded dialogue (Wizard of Wikipedia)

4. Key Findings

4.1 Hallucination Rates by Task
| Task | GPT-4 | Claude | Llama-2 |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| Factual QA | 8.3% | 7.1% | 15.2% |
| Summarization | 12.1% | 9.8% | 18.7% |
| Dialogue | 23.4% | 19.2% | 31.5% |

4.2 Contributing Factors
- Lower confidence scores correlate with hallucination (r=0.67)
- Questions about post-2021 events show 3x higher hallucination rates
- Multi-hop reasoning increases hallucination probability exponentially

5. Mitigation Strategies

5.1 Retrieval Augmentation
RAG reduces hallucination by 43% on knowledge-intensive tasks by grounding generation in retrieved documents.

5.2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Explicit reasoning steps reduce logical inconsistencies by 28%.

5.3 Self-Consistency Checking
Generating multiple responses and checking agreement catches 34% of hallucinations.

6. Conclusion

Hallucination remains an open problem. While mitigation strategies help, they do not eliminate the issue. Users must remain vigilant and implement verification systems for high-stakes applications.
