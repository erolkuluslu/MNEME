TITLE: Agentic AI Frameworks in 2025: From Chatbots to Autonomous Systems

## The Evolution from Chatbots to Agents

2024 marked the inflection point. We moved from LLMs as "fancy autocomplete" to systems that plan, execute, and iterate. The key insight: language models aren't just text generators—they're reasoning engines that can orchestrate complex workflows.

## What Makes an AI "Agentic"?

An agentic system exhibits:
1. **Goal-directed behavior**: Pursues objectives across multiple steps
2. **Tool use**: Interacts with external systems (APIs, databases, code execution)
3. **Memory**: Maintains context across interactions
4. **Reflection**: Evaluates own outputs and self-corrects
5. **Planning**: Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks

## Framework Comparison 2025

### LangChain / LangGraph
- Most mature ecosystem
- Graph-based workflow definition
- Strong tool integration
- Best for: Production-ready applications

### AutoGen (Microsoft)
- Multi-agent conversations
- Code execution built-in
- Research-oriented
- Best for: Complex collaborative tasks

### CrewAI
- Role-based agent design
- Sequential and hierarchical workflows
- Simple API
- Best for: Team-simulation scenarios

### DSPy
- Declarative prompt optimization
- Automatic few-shot learning
- Best for: Reliability-critical applications

## Architecture Patterns

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
```
Thought: I need to find the current stock price
Action: search_tool("AAPL stock price")
Observation: AAPL is trading at $178.50
Thought: Now I can answer the user's question
```

### Plan-and-Execute
1. Planner creates high-level steps
2. Executor handles each step
3. Re-planner adjusts based on results

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
```
User Request → Router Agent
                    ↓
    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
    ↓               ↓               ↓
Research Agent   Code Agent   Writing Agent
    └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                    ↓
            Synthesis Agent
                    ↓
            Final Response
```

## Memory Systems

### Short-term (Working Memory)
- Conversation buffer
- Sliding window (last N messages)
- Summary memory (compress old context)

### Long-term Memory
- Vector databases (semantic search)
- Entity memory (track mentioned entities)
- Episodic memory (remember past interactions)

## Tool Integration Best Practices

1. **Clear schemas**: Well-defined input/output types
2. **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when tools fail
3. **Rate limiting**: Prevent runaway API costs
4. **Sandboxing**: Isolate code execution environments

## The Alignment Challenge

Agentic systems amplify alignment concerns:
- **Goal specification**: Underspecified goals lead to unexpected behaviors
- **Corrigibility**: Agents must remain interruptible
- **Transparency**: Users should understand agent reasoning
- **Side effects**: Actions have real-world consequences

## Production Considerations

### Observability
- Log all agent steps
- Track token usage and latency
- Monitor for loops and stuck states

### Cost Management
- Set hard token limits
- Cache repeated queries
- Use smaller models for routing

### Human-in-the-loop
- Approval gates for sensitive actions
- Escalation paths when confidence is low
- Clear handoff protocols

## What's Next?

2025 trends to watch:
- **Computer use agents**: Direct UI interaction
- **Persistent agents**: Always-on systems with long-running goals
- **Federated agents**: Agents collaborating across organizations
- **Self-improving agents**: Agents that optimize their own prompts/tools

The future isn't chatbots that answer questions—it's AI systems that work alongside humans as capable collaborators.
