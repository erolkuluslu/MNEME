Abstract: Transfer learning has become the dominant paradigm in computer vision. This survey analyzes 150+ papers on adapting pretrained models (ImageNet, CLIP) to downstream tasks. We categorize approaches into fine-tuning, feature extraction, and domain adaptation, providing practitioners with actionable guidelines.

1. Introduction

Training deep neural networks from scratch requires massive datasets (millions of images) and substantial compute (hundreds of GPU-hours). Transfer learning circumvents this by leveraging knowledge from pretrained models.

The key insight: low-level features (edges, textures) learned on ImageNet transfer remarkably well to diverse downstream tasks—from medical imaging to satellite imagery.

2. Transfer Learning Taxonomy

2.1 Feature Extraction
- Freeze pretrained weights
- Train only final classifier layer
- Best when: limited data (<1000 samples), target domain similar to source

2.2 Fine-Tuning
- Initialize with pretrained weights
- Update all (or some) layers on target task
- Learning rate strategies: discriminative fine-tuning, gradual unfreezing

2.3 Domain Adaptation
- Source and target domains differ significantly
- Techniques: adversarial training, maximum mean discrepancy, self-training

3. Practical Guidelines

| Scenario | Data Size | Domain Similarity | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| A | Small | High | Feature extraction |
| B | Small | Low | Fine-tune top layers |
| C | Large | High | Fine-tune all layers |
| D | Large | Low | Train from scratch or domain adaptation |

4. Foundation Models

Recent foundation models (CLIP, ALIGN, Florence) trained on web-scale image-text pairs show unprecedented zero-shot transfer:
- CLIP achieves 76.2% ImageNet accuracy without any ImageNet training
- Linear probe on CLIP features outperforms full fine-tuning of ResNet-50

5. Conclusion

Transfer learning democratizes deep learning by reducing data and compute requirements. The emergence of foundation models suggests a future where task-specific training becomes unnecessary for many applications.
