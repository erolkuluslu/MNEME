Abstract: This review examines the parallels between biological synaptic plasticity and learning algorithms in artificial neural networks. We argue that incorporating biologically-inspired plasticity mechanisms could address current limitations in continual learning and catastrophic forgetting.

1. Introduction

"Neurons that fire together, wire together." This aphorism, summarizing Donald Hebb's 1949 postulate, describes how synaptic connections strengthen when pre- and post-synaptic neurons activate simultaneously. Modern neuroscience has revealed sophisticated molecular mechanisms underlying this plasticity.

2. Biological Mechanisms

2.1 Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)
- NMDA receptor activation triggers calcium influx
- CaMKII phosphorylation strengthens AMPA receptor responses
- Structural changes: spine enlargement, new synapse formation

2.2 Long-Term Depression (LTD)
- Low-frequency stimulation weakens connections
- Protein phosphatases dephosphorylate receptors
- Enables forgetting and memory refinement

3. Artificial Analogues

3.1 Backpropagation: Global error signal propagated through chain rule
- Non-local: requires symmetric weights (biologically implausible)
- Non-Hebbian: updates depend on downstream error, not local activity

3.2 Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
- Pre-before-post: strengthening (causal)
- Post-before-pre: weakening (anti-causal)
- Local computation: only requires information at the synapse

4. Catastrophic Forgetting

Standard ANNs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks. Biological brains avoid this through:
- Synaptic consolidation (important connections become "protected")
- Complementary learning systems (hippocampus + neocortex)
- Sparse, distributed representations

5. Future Directions

Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and progressive networks represent early attempts to incorporate plasticity principles. We propose that true continual learning may require:
- Local learning rules (Hebbian or STDP-like)
- Neuromodulation (dopamine-gated plasticity)
- Sleep-like consolidation phases
