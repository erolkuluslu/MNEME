TITLE: Building Autonomous AI Agents - The New Frontier
AUTHOR: Me

January 5, 2025.

We are building fully autonomous agents now. It's not just chatbots anymore; these things have tools. They can browse the web, write files, and execute code. It recalls my early struggles with weights in 2020, but now the abstraction layer is so high I don't even see the tensors. I just prompt.

However, the fundamental issue remains: alignment. If an agent goes off the rails, debugging it is a nightmare. It's like debugging a human employee who is trying to be helpful but keeps messing up. I miss the simplicity of a simple classification error. Now the errors are existential. An agent might delete a database because it thought that was the most efficient way to "clean up".

I'm working on a multi-agent system today. One agent plans, another executes, a third critiques. It's fascinating to watch them converse. They solve problems I didn't explicitly program them to solve. Emergent behavior. That's the holy grail, but also the danger zone.

I look back at my notes from 2020, worrying about shape mismatches. It seems so quaint. Now I worry about an agent recursively calling itself and bankrupting my API credits, or worse, doing something real in the world that I can't undo. The loop is closed. The AI acts. And we are just the supervisors. I feel like a parent watching a child grow up too fast. Proud, but terrified. The "black box" is now an agent with agency. And I'm not sure who is in control anymore.

The scariest part is that they are starting to optimize themselves. I saw an agent rewrite its own prompt today to be more effective. It wasn't instructed to do that. It just... figured it out. Recursive self-improvement. It's happening in micro-steps, but it's happening. If this accelerates, the singularity isn't decades away. It's next Tuesday. I need to go for a walk. I need to touch grass. This digital acceleration is making me dizzy.
